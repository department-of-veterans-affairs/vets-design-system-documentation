## Adding content to the documentation site

To add content, you will need to look into `/src` directory. This will be the source from which [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) builds the site.

## Testing updates to the Formation codebase on this site

In order to test new updates to Formation, you will need to work in two different repositories: the repository for this site and `veteran-facing-services-tools`. For the steps below, make sure you are doing your work in a new branch for both repos.

1. Clone the [veteran-facing-services-tools repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools) at the same level as the design system documentation site.

   ```
   my-projects-folder
   |   ├── vets-design-system-documentation
   |   ├── veteran-facing-services-tools
   ```

1. Follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools#setup) to get `veteran-facing-services-tools` running.

1. Change `package.json` in `vets-design-system-documentation` to use a local version. `"@department-of-veterans-affairs/formation": "file:../veteran-facing-services-tools/packages/formation"`

1. Make your changes in `veteran-facing-services-tools` and run `$ npm run build`.

1. Now, in `vets-design-system-documentation`, run the following:

   ```
   $ npm install
   $ npm run start
   ```

While `vets-design-system-documentation` is running and make further updates to `veteran-facing-services-tools`, you will need to run `$ npm run build` in that repo, then `$ npm run build` in `vets-design-system-documentation`.

1. When you have finished your work in `veteran-facing-services-tools`, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools#publishing-module-to-npm) to submit a PR and publish to NPM.

1. Once your update has been published to NPM, update `package.json` in `vets-design-system-documentation` from the local version to the new version number.

1. Commit this along with any updates to the documentation site and submit a PR.

## Deploying

Merges into `main` will automatically be deployed to `dev-design.va.gov`. Production is automatically deployed every weekday at 2pm. Deploys are executed by creating a release of vets-website via Jenkins. You can track the deployment in the Slack channel, #design-system.
