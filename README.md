# Vets Design System Documentation

TEST 
This repo is for VA Design System documentation, aka [design.va.gov](https://design.va.gov). If you are looking for the repo that contains the design system components, see the [component-library](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/component-library). Additionally, the [Formation package](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools/tree/master/packages/formation) inside the [veteran-facing-services-tools repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools) contains sitewide VA.gov base styles and utility classes.

Min specs:

## Adding content to the documentation site

To add content, you will need to look into `/src` directory. This will be the source from which [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) builds the site.

## Testing updates to the Formation codebase on this site

In order to test new updates to Formation, you will need to work in two different repositories: the repository for this site and `veteran-facing-services-tools`. For the steps below, make sure you are doing your work in a new branch for both repos.

1. Clone the [veteran-facing-services-tools repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools) at the same level as the design system documentation site.

   ```
   my-projects-folder
   |   ├── vets-design-system-documentation
   |   ├── veteran-facing-services-tools
   ```

1. Follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools#setup) to get `veteran-facing-services-tools` running.

1. Change `package.json` in `vets-design-system-documentation` to use a local version. `"@department-of-veterans-affairs/formation": "file:../veteran-facing-services-tools/packages/formation"`

1. Make your changes in `veteran-facing-services-tools` and run `$ npm run build`.

1. Now, in `vets-design-system-documentation`, run the following:

   ```
   $ yarn
   $ yarn start
   ```

While `vets-design-system-documentation` is running and make further updates to `veteran-facing-services-tools`, you will need to run `$ npm run build` in that repo, then `$ yarn build` in `vets-design-system-documentation`.

1. When you have finished your work in `veteran-facing-services-tools`, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools#publishing-module-to-npm) to submit a PR and publish to NPM.

1. Once your update has been published to NPM, update `package.json` in `vets-design-system-documentation` from the local version to the new version number.

1. Commit this along with any updates to the documentation site and submit a PR.

## Deployments

Merges into `main` will automatically deploy to production `design.va.gov` after CI checks have completed. 

### Previewing Pull Requests

When a PR is created, a preview of those changes will be available after the [Preview workflow](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/blob/main/.github/workflows/preview.yml) has completed. There will be a "View deployment" button visible that will launch the preview environment when clicked:

![The "view deployment" button on a pull request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/blob/main/src/images/readme/pr-view-deployment-button.png?raw=true)

The preview link can also be accessed directly using this pattern: `https://dev-design.va.gov/PR_NUMBER`. For example, `https://dev-design.va.gov/3435` where `3435` is the unique PR number visible in the PR title.

### Preview Troubleshooting

#### Check the branch name

A preview environment will generate only when the PR has been created from a direct branch from the main repository. It does not work if the PR was created from a fork.

You can confirm if your PR was created from a fork by looking at the branch name at the top of the PR. If you see your Github username in front of your branch name, this means the PR was created from a fork and the preview will not generate.

There is a Github username at the front of a branch name which means the branch is from a fork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/refs/heads/main/src/images/readme/pr-branch-from-fork.png)

If this was done because you don't have write access to this repository, you can request that access by submitting a support request in the #vfs-platform-support Slack channel.

#### Re-running the preview workflow

If the preview has stopped working (for example if you're only seeing a 403 Forbidden error or similar), re-run the preview workflow by clicking "Details" next to the Preview check:

Then click the "Re-run all jobs" button at the top of the page:
