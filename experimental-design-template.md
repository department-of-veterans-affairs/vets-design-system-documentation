# Experimental pattern name 

Briefly describe your proposed Experimental design pattern.

## Purpose

Talk about the "why" of your Experimental pattern. What problem will you be solving? How will this pattern improve the experience of veterans using va.gov and/or be an affordance for designers and developers working on the site?

## Example

Insert an image with callouts here, if you have one. Callouts should live as numbered text beneath the image (for accessibility reasons). If the image is large, callout text can live within the image itself as well as beneath it. Use the Anatomy callouts Sketch library in your mockups.

1. Callout one
2. Callout two
3. Callout three

## UX behavior 

Include placement and interaction details here.  

* Bullet points help keep things scannable.

## Additional notes

Add supplemental information and/or PR links here. You may delete this section if it isn't needed.

## Design mockups

* Links to images or Sketch files. 
* Include desktop and mobile versions.

## Accessibility notes

How does an engineer build the pattern to meet WCAG 2.1 standards? Include guidelines and code snippets here.
