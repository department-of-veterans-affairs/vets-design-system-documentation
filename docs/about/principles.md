# Design principles

These principles guide designers creating applications aligned with the Office of the Chief Technology Officer's (OCTO) standards.

## Usable by everyone

### Accessibility priority

Accessibility is core to all design decisions for users with disabilities.

### Mobile-first approach

Designing for smaller screens first helps prioritize critical information and tasks.

### Actionable options

Avoid dead ends by providing relevant next steps based on user data.

## Simple

### Task focus

Keep users centered on primary objectives without distractions.

### Breaking complexity

Segment complex tasks into logically ordered steps.

### Process over polish

Solve for clarity and consistency first, solve for polish second. Work through user flows and wireframes before high-fidelity design.

## Veteran first

### Collaborative design

Develop with Veterans rather than making assumptions about them.

### Research-driven

Validate conceptual approaches through research to respect Veterans' time.

### Functionality over aesthetics

Base your design decisions on whether the Veteran or caregiver can complete a task over what might "look right."

### Holistic journey

Veterans' experiences extend beyond VA.gov to broader government services.

## Impact

### Cross-platform consistency

Provide a uniform experience across tools, applications, and devices.

### Collaborative context

Work with OCTO and VA.gov Platform teams to align efforts and prioritize impact.
