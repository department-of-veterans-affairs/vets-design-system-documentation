# For Designers

This guide helps designers work effectively with the VA.gov Design System. Learn how to access resources, use components, and contribute to the design system.

## Getting Started

Before beginning design work, familiarize yourself with these core sections of the design system:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Foundation](/docs/foundation/) | Base styles, colors, typography, and spacing |
| [Components](/docs/components/) | Building blocks like buttons, forms, and alerts |
| [Patterns](/docs/patterns/) | Solutions combining components for common tasks |
| [Templates](/docs/templates/) | Full-page layouts with contextual variations |
| [Content](/docs/content-style-guide/) | Writing style guide for VA.gov |

## Design Resources

### Figma Libraries

The Design System Team provides a complete component library in Figma:

- **Core Components** - All production-ready components
- **Patterns** - Common interaction patterns
- **Templates** - Page-level layouts
- **Icons** - VA.gov icon set

#### Accessing Figma Libraries

1. Request access through your team lead
2. Enable the VA Design System library in your Figma project
3. Components will appear in your Assets panel

### Web Documentation

The website provides HTML and CSS examples of components and patterns in use. Use your browser's developer tools to view detailed specs for each element:

1. Right-click on any component
2. Select "Inspect"
3. View CSS properties, spacing, and colors

## Working with the Design System

### Using Foundation

Start with foundation elements to ensure consistency:

- **Colors** - Use only approved color tokens
- **Typography** - Apply standard font sizes and weights
- **Spacing** - Use the 8px spacing grid
- **Layout** - Use the 12-column flexbox grid

### Using Components

1. **Check existing components first** - Don't recreate what already exists
2. **Use components as designed** - Don't modify core component styles
3. **Follow usage guidelines** - Each component has specific guidance
4. **Consider accessibility** - Components are built to WCAG standards

### Creating New Designs

When existing components don't meet your needs:

1. **Document the gap** - Explain what's missing
2. **Propose a solution** - Design with reusability in mind
3. **Follow the contribution process** - Get approval before development
4. **Consider accessibility** - All new designs must meet WCAG 2.1 AA

## Design Review Checklist

Before handing off designs:

- [ ] Uses approved colors, typography, and spacing
- [ ] Components match design system specifications
- [ ] Responsive behavior is documented
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are noted
- [ ] Content follows style guide
- [ ] States are designed (default, hover, focus, error, disabled)

## Accessibility in Design

### Color Contrast

- **Normal text** - 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
- **Large text** - 3:1 contrast ratio minimum
- **UI components** - 3:1 contrast ratio minimum

### Focus States

- All interactive elements need visible focus indicators
- Use the standard focus style (yellow outline)

### Touch Targets

- Minimum 44x44px touch target size
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements

### Motion

- Provide alternatives to motion-based interactions
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion settings

## Contributing as a Designer

### Share Your Work

Contribute templates and patterns that could benefit other teams:

1. Document your design solution
2. Provide use cases and research
3. Submit through the contribution process

### Create New Components

When creating new components:

1. Align with existing design system patterns
2. Design for multiple contexts and states
3. Document accessibility requirements
4. Work with developers on implementation

### Improve Documentation

Help improve design system documentation by:

- Reporting unclear or missing guidance
- Suggesting examples and use cases
- Contributing design specs and rationale
