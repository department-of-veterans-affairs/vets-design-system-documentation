# Experimental components and patterns

The VA.gov Design System provides a dedicated section for experimental components and patterns that teams are actively exploring but haven't yet validated as best practices.

## Definition

An experimental component or pattern represents something that is being explored by a team on VA.gov, but has not yet been validated sufficiently by our Veterans and caregivers to become a best practice design system component or pattern.

These are marked as "Use with caution" on the [maturity scale](/docs/about/maturity-scale).

## Purpose

The experimental showcase serves several functions:

| Purpose | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Visibility | Creates transparency across different contractor teams and companies building on VA.gov |
| Collaboration | Prevents duplicate efforts by making teams aware of similar work happening elsewhere |
| Lightweight contribution | Enables teams to contribute emerging work back to the design system without a heavy approval process |

## Usage guidelines

Teams may use experimental components and patterns in their applications, but should:

- Recognize they haven't received full validation
- Proceed cautiously and test within their specific context
- Document any research findings on the component or pattern's documentation page for community benefit

## Contributing experimental work

If your team has developed a component or pattern that might benefit others:

1. Review the [contributing guidelines](./)
2. Submit an experimental design request
3. Share your research findings with the Design System Team

## Graduating to production

Experimental components can advance through the maturity scale as they:

- Gain research validation
- See adoption across multiple teams
- Demonstrate stability in production
