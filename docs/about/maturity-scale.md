# Maturity scale

The maturity scale categorizes components and patterns into three main status levels, each containing two sub-levels, to help practitioners understand usability confidence.

## Three major categories

| Category | Status levels | Guidance |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Use** | Deployed, Best practice | Ready for production use |
| **Use with caution** | Candidate, Available | May have limited validation |
| **Don't use** | Proposed, Deprecated | Not ready or no longer recommended |

## Six-level progression

### 1. Proposed

Request filed but not yet reviewed by Design System Team or Council.

### 2. Candidate

Evaluated by leadership. Documentation in progress. Possibly limited production use.

### 3. Available

Complete and ready for use. May or may not be in production. Has some research support.

### 4. Deployed

In production 3+ months. Adopted by multiple projects. Research-backed variations exist.

### 5. Best practice

Production use 1+ year. No significant issues. Multi-project adoption. Research-supported.

### 6. Deprecated

No longer recommended. May have significant issues or been superseded by alternatives.

## Advancement criteria

Three key factors determine progression:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Stability** | Production duration and issue severity (usability/accessibility quality) |
| **Research** | Usability tests or supporting research coverage |
| **Adoption** | Number of teams using it and breadth across VA.gov |

## Deprecation process

Components can be deprecated from any status if necessary. The system includes a formal deprecation procedure, with deprecated items remaining visible for three months before removal, directing users to preferred alternatives.
