intro: The email template serves as a design resource for communicating with Veterans through email. It's primarily used for transactional messages like submission confirmations, status updates, and account modifications, though it can also serve informational purposes.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Transactional messages.** Submission confirmations, status changes, and account updates."
    - value: "**Informational purposes.** General communications to Veterans."
    - value: "**Mockup preparation.** Preparatory tool for mockups in Figma before implementation through VA Notify."
  usability:
    - value: "**System fonts.** Limited email client support for custom fonts means typography uses system fonts."
    - value: "**VA Notify.** Emails deploy through VA Notify's Self Service Portal using markdown formatting."

structure:
  intro: The email template includes consistent header and footer sections with customizable body content.
  sections:
    - title: Header
      description: Contains VA logo with appropriate alt text. Responsive design with 600px breakpoint - centered seal on smaller screens, left-aligned on larger ones.
    - title: Heading
      description: Required H1 conveying email purpose. Should match or expand upon the subject line. Limited to one per email.
    - title: Salutation
      description: "Personalizes message using 'Dear ((first_name)),'. Avoids including last name due to PII concerns."
    - title: Body Content
