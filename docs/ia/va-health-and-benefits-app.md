# VA Health and Benefits App

The VA Health and Benefits app documentation provides guidance on the app's information architecture, including its organization, navigation structure, labeling systems, and indexing approaches to inform future design decisions.

## Core IA Structure

### Four Top-Level Categories

The app organizes content into four primary sections:

#### 1. Home

The default screen displaying personalized Veteran information and tasks across VA, plus general resources and lesser-used features like Profile and Settings.

- Includes Profile subcategory for infrequently updated personal data

#### 2. Health

All health-related features and statuses.

**Current features:**
- Appointments
- Prescriptions
- VA vaccine records
- Messaging

**Future:** Medical records

#### 3. Benefits

Benefit-related features excluding health.

**Current features:**
- Disability rating
- Claims
- VA Letters

**Future:** Education

#### 4. Payments

Unified financial management section.

**Current features:**
- VA payment history
- Direct deposit information

**Future:** Medical copays, Bills, Travel reimbursements

## Key IA Principles

When adding new features to the app's architecture:

- **Prioritize existing categories** before proposing new top-level categories
- **Maintain flat hierarchies** within categories
- **Group features** when a category exceeds six items
- **Ensure primary placements** - all features must have a primary location within the taxonomy
- **Apply user research** (card sorting) when content outgrows current structure

## Documentation Resources

The detailed sitemap/flow diagram in Figma serves as the source of truth and includes:
- System display logic
- Key actions
- Native mobile integration points

## Development Background

The current IA resulted from three research phases:

1. Two card-sorting rounds
2. Navigation model exploration
3. Evaluative testing with Veterans
