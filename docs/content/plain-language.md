# Plain Language

Plain language enables Veterans and their families to understand and access important benefits. Writing clearly makes compliance easier through clarity rather than complexity.

## Top 10 Plain Language Standards

### 1. Use Short Sentences

Limit each sentence to one subject and verb when possible. Break complex ideas into multiple sentences.

**Instead of:**
> Veterans who have served on active duty and have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable may be eligible for VA health care benefits if they meet certain requirements.

**Write:**
> You may qualify for VA health care if you served on active duty. You must have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.

### 2. Use Simple Words

Choose words familiar to Veterans and their families. Avoid complex terminology.

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| utilize | use |
| obtain | get |
| commence | start |
| terminate | end |
| facilitate | help |
| in the event that | if |
| at this point in time | now |
| in order to | to |

### 3. Use Active Voice

Connect actions to subjects. Make it clear who is responsible for the action.

| Passive (avoid) | Active (prefer) |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Benefits will be paid | We'll pay your benefits |
| Your application was received | We received your application |
| The form must be completed | Complete the form |

### 4. Define Complex Terms

Add plain language definitions in parentheses immediately after unfamiliar terms.

> You may qualify for Aid and Attendance (a monthly payment added to your pension).

### 5. Use Conversational Language

Address Veterans as individuals using "you" and "your." Refer to VA as "we" and "our."

**Instead of:**
> The Veteran must submit required documentation.

**Write:**
> You'll need to submit your documents.

### 6. Use Contractions

Employ contractions like "don't," "we'll," and "you're" for a natural, accessible tone.

| Formal | Conversational |
|--------|----------------|
| do not | don't |
| we will | we'll |
| you are | you're |
| cannot | can't |

### 7. Avoid Jargon

Eliminate bureaucratic, legal, and unnecessary acronymic language.

| Jargon | Plain language |
|--------|----------------|
| adjudicate | decide |
| promulgate | issue |
| effectuate | carry out |
| pursuant to | under |

### 8. Avoid Idioms

Don't use expressions that may confuse non-native English speakers.

| Idiom (avoid) | Clear alternative |
|---------------|-------------------|
| ball is in your court | you need to take action |
| touch base | contact |
| circle back | follow up |
| hit the ground running | start quickly |

### 9. Minimize Branded Names

Describe benefits instead of using program acronyms. Veterans care about what they can get, not what VA calls it internally.

**Instead of:**
> Apply for PCPG benefits.

**Write:**
> Apply for educational and career counseling.

### 10. Structure Content for Scanning

Use headings, bulleted lists, and accordions instead of dense paragraphs.

**Instead of:**
> To apply, you'll need to provide your DD214, Social Security number, current address, and contact information. You may also need to provide medical records if you're applying for disability benefits.

**Write:**
> **You'll need to provide:**
> - DD214 (discharge papers)
> - Social Security number
> - Current address and phone number
> - Medical records (for disability claims only)

## Testing Your Content

- Read content aloud—if it sounds unnatural, simplify it
- Ask someone unfamiliar with VA to read and explain it back
- Use readability tools to check grade level (aim for 6th-8th grade)
- Review with Veterans during usability testing
