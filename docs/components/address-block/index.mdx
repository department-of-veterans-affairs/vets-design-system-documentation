    description: For phone numbers in isolation
usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: Addresses in content blocks where the blue bar aids scanning
    - value: Form intro pages needing mailing addresses displayed
    - value: Calling out addresses within paragraph or list contexts
    - value: Highlighting VA facility contact information
  when_to_consider_else:
    - value: Addresses directly below a clear "Address" header (unnecessary on VA Health Center pages)
    - value: Series of 3+ addresses; use [Accordion](/docs/components/accordion) instead
    - value: Phone numbers in isolation; use [Telephone](/docs/components/telephone) component instead
content_considerations:
  - value: Spell out street names completely; avoid abbreviations
  - value: Defer to local compass point conventions (e.g., "N." vs. "North")
  - value: Format zip codes as 5-digit or with hyphen for extended format (12345-6789)
  - value: Write "PO" without periods for PO Box
  - value: Don't require Veterans to provide 9-digit zip codes; 5 digits is sufficient
  - value: Format provided addresses consistently with hyphenated extended zip codes
accessibility:
  - value: The component uses semantic HTML to ensure addresses are properly announced by screen readers
  - value: The visual styling (blue bar) provides additional context for sighted users
  - value: Ensure address content is logically structured with appropriate line breaks
