# Banner - Promo

:::danger Deprecated Component
This component is deprecated and should not be used in new development. Please use the [Banner](/docs/components/banner/) component instead.
:::

## Overview

The Banner - Promo component was previously used for promotional messaging and marketing content on VA.gov. This component has been deprecated in favor of using the standard Banner component.

- - -

## Migration

### Replace with Banner

Use the standard [Banner](/docs/components/banner/) component for all banner needs:

```html
<va-banner
  headline="Important announcement"
  type="info"
>
  <p>Your promotional message content here.</p>
</va-banner>
```

- - -

## Why was this deprecated?

* **Consolidation**: The design system consolidated banner variants to reduce complexity
* **Consistency**: A single Banner component provides more consistent implementation across VA.gov
* **Maintenance**: Fewer component variants reduce maintenance burden
