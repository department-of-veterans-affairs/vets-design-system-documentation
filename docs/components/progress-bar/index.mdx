  - name: Progress bar - Segmented
    url: ../form/progress-bar-segmented
    description: For form step indicators
  - name: Loading indicator
    url: ../loading-indicator
    description: For indeterminate loading states
usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**System status feedback**: Provide real-time progress updates when users initiate actions (e.g., file uploads)"
    - value: "**Determinate processes**: Use when progress percentage can be calculated and displayed accurately"
    - value: "Following the first usability heuristic: \"The design should always keep users informed about what is going on\""
  when_to_consider_else:
    - value: "**Form step indicators**: Use [Progress bar - Segmented](../form/progress-bar-segmented) instead for multi-step processes"
    - value: "**Indeterminate loading**: Use [Loading indicator](../loading-indicator) component when completion time is unknown"
  behavior:
    - value: Progress bar fills continuously until completion
    - value: Progress should never go backwards—once advanced, the percentage cannot decrease
    - value: Place near the UI element triggering the activity for proximity principle
content_considerations:
  - value: Provide a clear label describing what action is in progress
  - value: Keep labels concise but descriptive
  - value: Consider showing the percentage value alongside the visual bar for clarity
accessibility:
  - value: The `label` property provides accessible text for screen readers
  - value: Use `noPercentScreenReader` to control whether screen readers announce percentage updates
  - value: Progress updates are announced to assistive technology as the value changes
  - value: Ensure the progress bar has sufficient color contrast
