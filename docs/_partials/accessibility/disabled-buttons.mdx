### Do not disable buttons

**Avoid disabling buttons** when possible. Disabled buttons present several usability and accessibility problems:

**Problems with disabled buttons:**
- Screen readers may not announce disabled buttons or their labels
- Users can't understand why a button is disabled
- Low contrast makes disabled buttons hard to see
- Keyboard users can't focus on disabled buttons to learn their purpose

**Better alternatives:**

1. **Keep the button enabled** and show an error message when clicked with invalid input
2. **Hide the button entirely** until the user completes required fields
3. **Show a clear message** explaining what the user needs to do before proceeding

**If you must disable a button:**
- Provide visible text explaining why it's disabled
- Use `aria-describedby` to associate the explanation with the button
- Ensure the disabled state has sufficient contrast (3:1 minimum)

```html
<!-- If disabling is necessary -->
<button disabled aria-describedby="button-help">Submit</button>
<p id="button-help">Complete all required fields to submit.</p>
```
