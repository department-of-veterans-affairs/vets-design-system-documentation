intro: Use this pattern when collecting race and ethnicity information from Veterans. Only collect data VA doesn't already possess and ensure collection directly benefits the user experience.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Data VA doesn't have.** Only collect race and ethnicity data VA doesn't already possess."
    - value: "**User benefit.** Ensure collection directly benefits the user experience, not just VA operations."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**Ethnicity first.** Ethnicity precedes race as a separate, single-response question."
    - value: "**Multiple race selections.** Race uses checkboxes to allow multiple selections."
    - value: "**Include prefer not to answer.** Provide 'Prefer not to answer' option for both questions."
    - value: "**Mark as optional.** Both questions should be clearly labeled as optional."
    - value: "**Explain the benefit.** Clearly explain how providing this information helps the user."
    - value: "**Stay in flow.** Do not remove the user from the task at hand to communicate details about this data collection."
  when_not_to_use:
    - value: "**Contact Design System team first.** This pattern faces potential deprecation. Consult the Design System team before implementing."

examples:
  - title: Ethnicity question
    description: Single-response question about ethnicity with prefer not to answer option.
  - title: Race question
    description: Checkbox question allowing multiple race selections with prefer not to answer option.

how_to_build:
  intro: The race and ethnicity pattern uses separate questions for each demographic.
  steps:
    - value: "Ethnicity question first: Use radio buttons or single-select for ethnicity."
    - value: "Race question second: Use checkboxes to allow multiple selections."
    - value: "Include 'Prefer not to answer' option for both questions."
    - value: "Mark both questions as optional with clear labeling."
    - value: "If 'Prefer not to answer' is selected, it negates other selections."
    - value: "Keep explanatory content brief and policy-compliant within the workflow."
  components_used:
    - name: Checkbox
      url: /docs/components/form/checkbox
    - name: Radio button
      url: /docs/components/form/radio-button

accessibility:

  - value: "Fieldset and legend must properly group related options."
  - value: "Optional field indicators should be announced by screen readers."
