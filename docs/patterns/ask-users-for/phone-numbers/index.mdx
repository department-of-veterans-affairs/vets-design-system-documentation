intro: Use this pattern when collecting phone numbers for contact purposes, supporting both domestic and international formats.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Collecting contact phone numbers.** When you need to reach users about their application or request."
    - value: "**Gathering outreach information.** When phone is a preferred or required contact method."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**Validate phone numbers.** Users must provide a valid domestic or international phone number."
    - value: "**Make phone required when primary.** Phone fields are required when selected as the primary contact method."
    - value: "**Require mobile for text opt-in.** Mobile numbers are mandatory if the user opts into text message communications."
    - value: "**Pair with email.** Phone collection typically appears alongside email address on the same form step."
    - value: "**Explain data usage.** Tell users how their phone number will be used."

examples:
  - title: With country codes
    description: Phone number fields that include country code selection for international numbers.
  - title: Without country codes
    description: Domestic-only phone number fields for US numbers.

how_to_build:
  intro: The phone number pattern supports multiple formats and validation rules.
  steps:
    - value: "Use the telephone input component for proper formatting and validation."
    - value: "Include country code selector for international number support when needed."
    - value: "Validate both domestic formats (703-123-4567, 7031234567) and international formats (+52 123 456-7890)."
    - value: "Distinguish between home and mobile phone numbers."
  components_used:
    - name: Telephone input
      url: /docs/components/form/telephone-input

code_usage: |
  The `phonePattern` is available as a web-component pattern in the VA Forms library.

  ```jsx
  import { phonePattern } from '@department-of-veterans-affairs/platform-forms-system/patterns';
  ```

  **Acceptable US formats:**
  - 703-123-4567
  - 7031234567

  **Acceptable international formats:**
  - +52 123 456-7890
  - 637031234567

content_considerations:
  - value: "Use 'Home phone number' and 'Mobile phone number' rather than primary/secondary terminology."
  - value: "Display collected numbers per the VA.gov content style guidelines."
  - value: "Avoid jargon; maintain a plain language approach."

content_specs:
  - field: Home phone number
    hint_text: For international numbers, select or enter your country code
    error_message: Enter a 10-digit phone number (with or without dashes)
  - field: Mobile phone number
    hint_text: For international numbers, select or enter your country code
    error_message: Enter a 10-digit phone number (with or without dashes)

accessibility:
  - value: "Ensure phone fields have visible, associated labels."
  - value: "Use autocomplete='tel' for home phone and autocomplete='tel' for mobile."
  - value: "Provide clear error messages that explain the expected format."
  - value: "Support keyboard-only input for country code selection."
