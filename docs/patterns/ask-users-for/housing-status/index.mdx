intro: Use this pattern to ask Veterans about their current housing situation, allowing them to accurately disclose their living circumstances including potential housing instability.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Collecting housing information.** When you need to gather information about a Veteran's housing or living situation."
    - value: "**Assessing housing instability.** When forms need to identify temporary living arrangements or housing risks."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**Use criteria-based self-identification.** Rather than a simple yes/no homelessness question, use a series of criteria to help users self-identify their circumstances."
    - value: "**Apply conditional logic.** Route users to appropriate follow-up questions based on their housing situation."
    - value: "**Consider point-of-contact.** Optionally collect emergency contact information for housing-unstable Veterans."
  when_not_to_use:
    - value: "**API limitations.** When the backend API cannot accommodate the gathered information."

examples:
  - title: Housing criteria checklist
    description: Series of checkboxes allowing users to identify their housing circumstances.
  - title: Conditional mailing address
    description: Mailing address collection that appears based on housing status selection.

how_to_build:
  intro: The housing status pattern uses conditional logic to route users appropriately.
  steps:
    - value: "Present housing criteria as checkboxes for self-identification."
    - value: "Affirmative responses to housing instability options direct users to mailing address question."
    - value: "'Other housing risks' responses route to a secondary form before mailing address."
    - value: "'None apply' responses proceed directly to the address pattern."
    - value: "Optionally collect point-of-contact information."

accessibility:
  - value: "Ensure all form controls are keyboard accessible."
  - value: "Provide clear labels that don't stigmatize housing-unstable users."
  - value: "Use trauma-informed language throughout the pattern."
