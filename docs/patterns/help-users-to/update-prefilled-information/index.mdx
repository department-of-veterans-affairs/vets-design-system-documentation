intro: Use this pattern to help users understand how to modify information that has been automatically filled into forms, including what can be edited online versus what requires other methods.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Prefilled forms.** When information is prefilled into forms or tools."
    - value: "**Clarity on updates.** When users need clarity on updating sensitive data they cannot modify online."
    - value: "**Save location communication.** When you need to communicate where changes will be stored."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**System status visibility.** Keep users informed about what data they can modify."
    - value: "**User control.** Provide control over personal information."
    - value: "**Clear save behavior.** Explain whether changes affect just the form or their VA profile."
  when_not_to_use:
    - value: "**No prefilled information.** When no information is prefilled in the form."
    - value: "**Unauthenticated users.** When users are not signed in."
    - value: "**Forms without sign-in.** When forms don't require sign-in."

examples:
  - title: Non-editable information cards
    description: Display without edit links, includes phone/contact instructions.
  - title: Editable information cards
    description: Include edit links for updatable fields like addresses.
  - title: User-controlled saving
    description: Radio buttons let users decide if changes update their profile.
  - title: Success confirmations
    description: Alerts confirm where changes were saved.

how_to_build:
  intro: The pattern addresses both editable and non-editable prefilled data.
  steps:
    - value: "Omit edit links for non-editable prefilled data."
    - value: "Include 'Note:' sections with phone numbers for updating restricted information."
    - value: "Display informational alerts before changes confirming sync behavior."
    - value: "Use radio buttons for optional profile updates."
    - value: "Show success alerts after changes are saved."
    - value: "Implement error states if required data is missing."

content_considerations:
  - value: "Verify directions for updating uneditable information with subject matter experts and call centers."
  - value: "Ensure accuracy for specific forms and benefits."
  - value: "Use colored tags to indicate missing required fields."

accessibility:
  - value: "Edit links must be clearly labeled for screen readers."
  - value: "Success and error alerts must be announced to screen readers."
  - value: "Phone numbers should be formatted as clickable links on mobile."
