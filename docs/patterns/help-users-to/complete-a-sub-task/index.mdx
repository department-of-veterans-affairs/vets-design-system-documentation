intro: Use this pattern to help users complete a shorter task before or within a larger process. This pattern replaces the deprecated Wizard pattern and applies the "One thing per page" principle.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Multiple eligibility pathways.** When tasks require users to navigate multiple eligibility pathways."
    - value: "**Shorter tasks in larger processes.** When completing shorter tasks within larger processes spanning multiple touchpoints."
    - value: "**Branching eligibility.** When branching eligibility choices guide users toward optimal pathways."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**One thing per page.** Limit questions to two or three maximum per screen."
    - value: "**Reduce cognitive load.** Keep decisions simple and focused."
    - value: "**No dead ends.** Always provide next steps at completion or transition points."
    - value: "**Use alerts for clarity.** When exiting the sub-task, use alerts to communicate status."
  when_not_to_use:
    - value: "**Standard form flows.** Don't use as a replacement for standard form flows."
    - value: "**Simple eligibility.** When eligibility information fits concisely on an introduction page."
    - value: "**Standalone forms.** Forms without progress indicators and button pairs."

examples:
  - title: Supplemental Claim sub-task
    description: Determines if service suits user needs through single-question branching.
  - title: Pre-Check-in Experience
    description: Verifies current information accuracy before facility visits.
  - title: VAOS Vaccine screening
    description: Screens vaccination status within broader scheduling process.

how_to_build:
  intro: Start with content design creating simple, plain-language questions on distinct pages.
  steps:
    - value: "Structure logic trees gathering information in minimal questions."
    - value: "Avoid showing irrelevant content."
    - value: "Always provide next steps—no dead ends."
    - value: "Clearly mark completion or transition points."
    - value: "Use alerts for clarity when exiting the sub-task."
    - value: "Order essential required questions before optional ones."
  components_used:
    - name: Accordion
      url: /docs/components/accordion
    - name: Alert
      url: /docs/components/alert
    - name: Button pair
      url: /docs/components/button
    - name: Action link
      url: /docs/components/link/action

content_considerations:
  - value: "Use plain language exclusively."
  - value: "Order essential required questions before optional ones."
  - value: "Avoid nested questions within single prompts."
  - value: "Group related questions by topic."
  - value: "Use research and card sorting for question sequencing."
  - value: "Use clear button labels."

accessibility:
  - value: "Each page's H1 title must be unique."
  - value: "Title tags should reference the form/task name consistently."
  - value: "Radio options with submit buttons preferred over Yes/No button pairs for backward navigation."
  - value: "Avoid deprecated Wizard patterns: unclear endpoints, accidental focus jumping, hidden validation, nested fieldsets."
  - value: "Maintain minimal page design allowing quick navigation to first question."
