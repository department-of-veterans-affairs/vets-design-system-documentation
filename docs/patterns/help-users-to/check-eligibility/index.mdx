intro: Use this pattern to help users check their eligibility for a benefit or service, providing early feedback that can reduce application rejection rates.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Potential ineligibility.** When users may not qualify for a requested benefit or service."
    - value: "**Early feedback.** When early feedback on eligibility can reduce application rejection rates."
    - value: "**User control.** When presenting eligibility status gives users control to exit lengthy processes or correct mistakes."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**Useful friction.** Introduce useful friction by anticipating possible errors that lead to rejected applications."
    - value: "**Give users control.** Give users freedom to exit or correct information early in the process."
  when_not_to_use:
    - value: "**Not a substitute for clear criteria.** Don't use as a substitute for clear, plain-language eligibility criteria."
    - value: "**Brief requirements.** When eligibility requirements are brief enough for the introduction page."
    - value: "**Searchable content.** When eligibility info is concise enough to be easily searchable."

examples:
  - title: Eligibility check flow
    description: Two-step process showing eligibility feedback with options to exit, save, or continue.

how_to_build:
  intro: The check eligibility pattern provides feedback on met and unmet requirements.
  steps:
    - value: "Alert users if they don't meet requirements using an Alert component."
    - value: "Offer options: exit, save-for-later, or continue anyway."
    - value: "Provide clear summary showing met and unmet eligibility requirements."
    - value: "Enable users to adjust their answers if they believe they made a mistake."
  components_used:
    - name: Alert
      url: /docs/components/alert
    - name: Card
      url: /docs/components/card

accessibility:
  - value: "Alert components must be properly announced to screen readers."
  - value: "Ensure eligibility status is clearly communicated."
  - value: "All interactive elements (exit, save, continue) must be keyboard accessible."
