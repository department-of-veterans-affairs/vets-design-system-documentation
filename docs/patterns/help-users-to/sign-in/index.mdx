intro: Use this pattern for products requiring or allowing sign-in to VA.gov or VA online services, with tailored alerts for verified vs. unverified access scenarios.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Products requiring sign-in.** When your product requires users to sign in to VA.gov or VA online services."
    - value: "**Verified account access.** When services need verified account authentication."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**Use standard alerts.** Select one of two blue alert variations (required vs. optional sign-in)."
    - value: "**Handle unverified accounts.** Implement all three yellow verification alerts for unverified accounts."
    - value: "**Conditional display.** Alerts display conditionally based on user sign-in status and account type."
    - value: "**Collaborate on custom implementations.** Work with CAIA and identity teams for custom implementations."
  when_not_to_use:
    - value: "**Unverified accounts accepted.** Products that accept unverified accounts may need adjustments."
    - value: "**No prefill capability.** Products that allow sign-in without prefill capability."
    - value: "**Alternative incentives.** Products with alternative sign-in incentives (e.g., Intent to File generation)."
    - value: "**My HealtheVet specific.** Products requiring My HealtheVet registration specifically."

examples:
  - title: Required sign-in (verified)
    description: Blue alert indicating sign-in is required for verified accounts.
  - title: Optional sign-in (verified)
    description: Blue alert indicating sign-in is optional but recommended.
  - title: Verify account alerts
    description: Yellow alerts prompting users to verify with ID.me or Login.gov.

how_to_build:
  intro: The sign-in pattern uses alert variations based on sign-in requirements and account status.
  steps:
    - value: "Select the appropriate blue alert: required sign-in or optional sign-in."
    - value: "Implement all three yellow verification alerts for unverified accounts."
    - value: "Display alerts conditionally based on user sign-in status."
    - value: "Support account types: Login.gov, ID.me, My HealtheVet."
    - value: "Request identity team review of pull requests."
    - value: "Obtain CAIA content review for any content changes."
  components_used:
    - name: Alert - sign-in
      url: /docs/components/alert

content_considerations:
  - value: "Do not modify alert content without CAIA approval."
  - value: "These alerts typically serve as the sole sign-in messaging."
  - value: "Reference the style guide section on sign-in and identity verification for additional content needs."

accessibility:
  - value: "Follow VA.gov accessibility standards for all alert components."
  - value: "Ensure sign-in buttons and links are keyboard accessible."
  - value: "Alert content must be announced to screen readers."
