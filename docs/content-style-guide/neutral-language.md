# Neutral language

The VA aims to create accurate, clear language accessible to all audiences.

## Referring to people

### Pronoun usage

Use "they" and "their" instead of gendered alternatives like "he or she" or "his or her."

:::tip Do this
- "Learn about how a Veteran can transfer their unused Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to you."
- "If your provider has filled out the form electronically, they must print it out to sign it."
:::

:::danger Not this
- "Learn about how a Veteran can transfer his or her unused Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to you."
:::

### Family relationships

Use inclusive terms rather than gender-specific ones:

| Use | Instead of |
|-----|------------|
| Spouse or partner | Husband/wife |
| Child or dependent child | Son/daughter |
| Stepchild | Stepson/stepdaughter |
| Parent | Mother/father |

:::note
Backend form fields may require alignment with specific terms based on system requirements.
:::

## Device and experience-neutral language

### Avoid sensory-based verbs

Don't use "view," "see," "hear," or "listen" since users access content differently.

| Use | Instead of |
|-----|------------|
| Go to | See |
| Review | View |
| Check | Look at |
| Read | See |
| Play | Listen to |

### Replace interaction-specific terms

Instead of "click," "press," or "tap," use "select" across all platforms.

:::tip Example
Select **Submit**

Not: "Tap the button" or "Click Submit"
:::

### Eliminate directional language

Avoid references to screen position (top right, below) because responsive design and accessibility tools affect layout differently for each user.

### Remove color references

Don't instruct users to select "the blue button." Use the label name instead.

## Role and title language

### Use first-person references

Describe VA as "we/us" rather than naming internal offices (VBA, VHA, NCA). This minimizes jargon unfamiliar to Veterans.

### Minimize branded program names

Describe the benefit or program rather than its official branded name.

### Avoid specific staff titles

Unless Veterans need a specific role name to contact the right person, use "We'll review" instead of naming job titles.
