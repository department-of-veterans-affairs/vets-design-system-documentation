# Government forms

Guidelines for referencing and presenting government forms in content, with emphasis on clarity for Veterans.

## Body copy guidelines

### First mention

Lead with the form name, followed by the form number in parentheses using "VA Form" prefix:

> "Use the Health Benefits Update form (VA Form 10-10EZR) to update your personal, financial, and insurance information."

This approach prioritizes clarity since VA form names tend to be very long and are difficult for readers to scan quickly.

### Subsequent references

After initial mention, refer to forms by "VA Form" plus the number alone:

> "Send the completed VA Form 10-10EZR and any supporting documents to us."

Alternatively, use generic references when context is clear: "Send the completed form and any supporting documents to us."

## CTA links, headers, and UI elements

In interactive elements, use the form number rather than full name. Ensure the complete form name appears nearby for clarity.

**Example:**
- CTA link text: "Download VA Form 21P-530 (PDF)"
- Supporting context: "Application for Burial Benefits (VA Form 21P-530)"

## Exception: Common names

Some forms are known by casual names Veterans recognize. Reference these by the familiar term rather than official designation:

> "Find out how to request your military records, including your DD214, through milConnect."

Common exceptions include DD214 (instead of formal title) and DD149/DD293.

## Key principle

Prioritize Veteran comprehension over strict form nomenclature when balancing formal accuracy with accessibility.
