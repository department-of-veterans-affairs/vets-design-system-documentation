# Numbers, signs, and symbols

## Numbers

### Use numerals for all numbers

VA.gov differs from AP Style by using numerals for all numbers, including 1-10. Numerals are easier to scan on a screen and help readers with lower literacy levels and non-native English speakers.

:::tip Examples
- "You must meet at least 1 of these eligibility requirements"
- "Get help completing your application, including one-on-one consultation"
:::

### Exceptions

- Spell out "one" in expressions like one-on-one, one-time, and "one of the reasons"
- Use the numeral "1" in all other instances
- Spell out ordinals first through tenth unless in a series or range
- Use 11th, 12th, etc. after tenth

:::tip Example
All runners-up from 5th to 11th place will receive an honorable mention.

## Signs and symbols

### Ampersand (&)

Avoid ampersands in headers and body copy. Spell out "and" instead.

**Exception:** Use ampersands in proper nouns like program names (VR&E program).

### Dollar sign ($)

Use the dollar sign instead of spelling out "dollars." In tables, add "$" so screen readers interpret it as currency.

:::tip Example
We'll pay the tuition and mandatory fees up to $27,120.05
:::

### Degree symbol

Use with specific numbers. No space between the number and symbol or between the symbol and F/C.

:::tip Example
The temperature was 10°C

Not: "10 °C"
:::

### Percent sign (%)

Use numerals with the % symbol. No space between the number and symbol. This follows scientific and technical writing standards.

:::tip Example
a disability rating of 10% to 100%
