# Capitalization

The VA.gov design system uses **sentence case capitalization** as its standard approach for most content. This means capitalizing only the first word and proper nouns, reflecting plain language principles.

## Where to apply sentence case

- Page titles
- Headings and subheadings
- Button labels
- Text links
- Mobile app interface buttons

**Example:** "Apply now for GI Bill benefits"

Avoid capitalizing common words merely for emphasis or visual importance.

## Exceptions: Title capitalization

Capitalize the following:

- **Proper nouns:** branded terms like "VA.gov," official program names, state names, federal agency names, days of the week, months
- **The word "Veterans"** (always capitalized)
- **Global navigation labels:** VA Benefits and Health Care; About VA; Find a VA Location
- **Mobile app native actions:** Use title case for iOS; use all caps for Android

## Exceptions: Initial capitalization

- **SEO title tags** employ initial capitalization (example: "VA Prescription Refill And Tracking | Veterans Affairs")

## Reference resources

For uncertain cases, consult:

- The VA.gov content style guide word list
- AP Style guidelines

When in doubt, default to sentence case capitalization.
