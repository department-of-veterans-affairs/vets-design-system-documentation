# Naming and labels

Avoid creating unnecessary brand names and labels. Use descriptive plain language labels instead of branded terms.

## Don't create new brands

Creating branded names causes problems:

1. **Imposes internal terminology on users** - Veterans shouldn't need to learn VA's internal vocabulary
2. **Creates confusing sub-brands** - Multiple branded names fragment the VA experience
3. **Requires expensive marketing** - Educating audiences about branded terms takes significant resources

## Use plain language instead

Rather than inventing branded names, call it what it is using everyday vocabulary that audiences already understand. This approach aligns with content principles and improves discoverability.

:::tip Do this
- "VA combined disability rating calculator"
- "View your electricity bill"
:::

:::danger Not this
- "The Combinator"
- "Pepco Green Button"
:::

## Avoid acronym branding

Don't create new acronyms in Veteran-facing content that aren't commonly used and understood by them already. Internal shorthand shouldn't appear in customer-facing materials as branded terminology.
