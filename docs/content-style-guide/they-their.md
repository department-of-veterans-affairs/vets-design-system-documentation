# They, their

Use "they" and "their" as singular pronouns rather than gendered alternatives like "he or she" or "his or her."

## Why we use they/their

Using "they" and "their" eliminates unnecessary wordiness while remaining inclusive. This recommendation aligns with *The New Fowler's Modern English Language* (third edition) and *Garner's Modern American Usage* (third edition).

## Examples

:::tip Do this
- "Learn about how a Veteran can transfer their unused Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to you."
- "If your provider has filled out the form electronically, they must print it out to sign it."
:::

:::danger Not this
- "Learn about how a Veteran can transfer his or her unused Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to you."
- "If your provider has filled out the form electronically, he or she must print it out to sign it."
