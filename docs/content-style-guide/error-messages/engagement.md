# Engagement messages

Engagement messages prompt users to complete tasks or enter data. These can be system-initiated or user-initiated nudges.

## Continuing saved applications

Use when a user has a saved application that's approaching expiration.

**Component:** Alert box (Informational state)

:::tip Example
**Still want to apply for [BENEFIT NAME]?**

Your saved application will expire on [DATE]. If you don't submit your application by that date, you'll need to start over.

[Continue your application] [Start over]
:::

## Two-factor authentication setup

Encourage users to set up additional security.

**Component:** Alert box (Informational state)

:::tip Example
**Want to make your VA.gov account more secure?**

You can add an optional extra layer of security to your account. This helps make sure that only you can access your account—even if someone gets your password.
:::

## Work-in-progress for unauthenticated users

Display on form introduction pages to encourage sign-in.

**Component:** Alert box (Informational state)
**Location:** Form Introduction page

:::tip Example
**Sign in now to save time and save your work in progress**

When you're signed in to your VA.gov account:
- We can prefill some of your information to save you time
- You can save your work in progress and come back later to finish filling out your form
- After you submit, you can track the status of your application
:::

## Prefill notifications for authenticated users

Let signed-in users know their information has been auto-populated.

**Component:** Alert box (Informational state)

:::tip Example
**We've prefilled some of your information**

We've prefilled some of your information from your account. If you need to correct anything, you can edit the pre-filled information. When you submit this form, we'll update your information in your account.
:::

## Autosave confirmation

Display after a form saves successfully.

**Component:** Alert with background-only styling and icon
**State:** Success
**Location:** After form step button pair

:::tip Example
Your application has been saved. Your application ID number is [ID NUMBER]. It was last saved on [DATE] at [TIME].

These messages typically use:
- Alert boxes in various states (Informational, Success)
- Progress bars to show completion status
- Button pairs for action choices
- Clear placement within form step pages
