# Content principles

The VA.gov Design System emphasizes creating better content through intentional language practices that support Veterans' needs and improve their site experience.

## Better content, not better bureaucracy

The primary goal is enabling consistent, clear, and customer-centered content without adding unnecessary bureaucratic layers.

## Four defining characteristics of better content

### 1. Consistent

Use words uniformly to build trust and confidence with customers.

### 2. Conversational

Employ everyday language and plain speech rather than government jargon.

### 3. Clear and helpful

Break complex information into digestible pieces, delivered progressively at appropriate moments to prevent overwhelming users.

### 4. Empathetic

Communicate person-to-person with customers, prioritizing the individual over their circumstances.

## Foundation in user research

These principles derive directly from Veteran feedback. Research participants expressed preferences for:

- Manageable information delivery
- Consistent intuitive labeling
- Genuine empathy over formality
- Customer service standards matching commercial online experiences
