# Claims and applications

This guide establishes consistent terminology for discussing VA claims and applications across communications channels. These terms are intentional and often not interchangeable.

## Key principle

In reusable content that appears in many types of applications, requests, and static pages (like an alert), use the general term "form" instead of "claim," "application," or "request" to avoid confusion.

## Terminology definitions

### Application / Apply

Used when someone submits an initial request for non-disability benefits. Veterans "apply" for pensions, DIC, and similar benefits.

:::tip Example
Apply for VA health care benefits.
:::

### Claim / File a claim

Primarily used for disability filings. Also applies to reimbursement claims and life insurance. Reflects the Veteran's right to compensation.

:::tip Example
File a claim for disability compensation.
:::

### Claimant / Applicant

Refers to the person with the claim or the person applying for benefits.

:::tip Define as
- "person with the claim"
- "person applying for this benefit"
:::

Plain language alternatives are preferred when possible. For example, use "Veteran's spouse" instead of "claimant" when referring to a spouse.

### Claim exam

Determines service-connected disability status and assigns ratings.

:::tip First mention
VA claim exam (also known as a compensation and pension, or C&P, exam)
:::

### Document

The digital or paper item submitted as evidence supporting a claim or application.

### Evidence

All documents and information submitted to support a claim or application.

:::tip Define as
supporting documents or information
:::

### File (noun)

The actual uploaded file from a user's device (.pdf, .jpg, .png, etc.). Upload buttons should read "Upload file."

### Request

A formal ask for action or an item—such as requesting a decision review or Presidential Memorial Certificate. Typically doesn't require explaining eligibility.

:::tip Example
Request a decision review if you disagree with our decision.
:::

### Sponsor

The Veteran whose earned benefits a family member accesses.

:::tip Define as
the Veteran you're connected to (called your "sponsor")
:::

## When to use each term

| Term | Use for |
|------|---------|
| Apply / Application | Non-disability benefits (health care, pension, education, DIC) |
| Claim / File a claim | Disability compensation, reimbursement, life insurance |
| Request | Decision reviews, certificates, records, specific items |
| Form | Reusable content that appears across multiple benefit types |

## Implementation note

Existing VA.gov content may not yet reflect these standards. Apply these guidelines when creating new content or updating existing content.
