# Trademarks

Some VA program and benefit names are registered trademarks. Follow these guidelines for trademark symbol usage.

## Key guidelines

### First mention only

Include the trademark symbol (®) in the first prominent mention, only once and only on the relevant section of the website.

### Restricted placement

Avoid using trademark symbols in:
- Links
- Buttons
- Breadcrumbs
- Navigation labels

## Example: GI Bill

The GI Bill® serves as an example. The trademark symbol appears on the Education and training hub landing page as the primary location.

If no suitable spot exists on a hub page, place it instead on the specific benefits page (such as "About the GI Bill benefits"), but not in both locations.

When mentioning the GI Bill on unrelated pages—disability, careers, pension sections—the symbol should be omitted.

## Context

There's no specific legal guidance for VA trademarks, but we follow this general practice on the web as a best practice rather than a legal requirement.
