# Punctuation and formatting

## Punctuation rules

### Apostrophes

Use curly apostrophes (don't) instead of straight ones (don't).

### Commas

Apply the Oxford comma before conjunctions in series of 3 or more items to prevent misreading.

:::tip Example
We provide health care, education, and housing benefits.
:::

### Contractions

VA.gov embraces contractions for conversational tone, except in certain legal contexts. Avoid non-standard forms like "would've" or "could've."

:::tip Use
- don't
- can't
- we'll
- you're
:::

### Em dashes

Use without spaces on either side to set off important clauses.

:::tip Example
You may be eligible if you have an illness or injury caused—or made worse—by your time in service.
:::

### En dashes

Avoid them since screen readers don't announce them consistently.

### Hyphens

Connect modifying words and names without spacing.

:::tip Examples
- active-duty service member
- VA-related claim
:::

### Exclamation points

Never use in body copy, headers, labels, or CTAs. This aligns with VA.gov's conversational, straightforward voice without hyperbole.

### Quotation marks

- Use curly marks around free-text form submissions
- Place periods and commas inside quotation marks
- Other punctuation goes outside unless it's part of the quote
- Don't quote buttons or headers—use bold instead

### Form field punctuation

- **Hint text:** Add periods for complete sentences; omit for fragments
- **Error messages:** Skip periods unless 2 or more sentences exist

## Formatting standards

### Notes

- Place on separate lines after relevant text
- Capitalize and bold "Note:"
- For list items, position directly after the specific item with soft returns, maintaining list indentation

:::tip Example
**Note:** This requirement applies only to applications submitted after January 1, 2024.
:::

### Error messages

- Use sentence case and bold formatting
- Start with action verbs ("Select," "Enter")
- Quote specific form elements
- Omit periods unless multiple sentences are present
