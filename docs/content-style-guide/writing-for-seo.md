# Writing for SEO

SEO success depends on creating relevant, high-quality content that answers what people actually search for, not just optimizing technical elements.

## SEO best practices for copy

### Content strategy

- Address actual user search queries with unique, relevant information
- Place primary keywords in the H1 (page title), H2 (section headers), and introductory text
- Limit pages to one H1; reserve it for the page title only
- Integrate primary and secondary keywords naturally throughout body copy and headers without "keyword stuffing"

### Content structure

- Use H2s and H3s consistently to structure content hierarchy for scannable organization
- Include primary keywords in URLs when possible
- Avoid thin pages lacking sufficient depth; instead create comprehensive pages on a topic
- Incorporate personalized, conversational Q&A matching actual user search queries

### User experience

- Write scannable, easily understood navigation and content
- Use active voice and conversational language

## Meta properties

### Title tags and meta descriptions

- Create unique titles and descriptions for every page
- Avoid duplicate tags across pages (damages SEO and confuses users)
- These help users identify page content in search results and reinforce VA's brand authority

### Meta description guidelines

| Guideline | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Character limit | Under 300 characters (including spaces) |
| Primary keyword placement | Within first 155 characters |
| Secondary keywords | Incorporate naturally |
| Calls to action | Include when space permits |
| Voice | Active voice and plain language |
