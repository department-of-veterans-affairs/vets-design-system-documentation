# Bulleted and numbered lists

Lists improve scannability and comprehension. When sentences contain more than three items or ideas, breaking them into a list format is recommended.

## List selection

- Use numbered lists for steps requiring a specific sequence
- Use bulleted lists for items without required order

## List introduction

- Introduce lists with complete sentences
- Avoid phrases like "the following"; use "these" instead
- Don't combine introduction with list item starting words

## List structure

- Never create single-item lists
- Minimize sub-bullets; create separate lists if needed
- Keep items to 1-2 sentences maximum
- Limit lists to 7 items; use subheads for longer lists
- Maintain parallel construction throughout

## Conjunctions

- When using "and" or "or," bold and place at end of each item
- Never use "and/or"; instead list all options separately

## Punctuation rules

We determine punctuation by list, not by page:

- **Fragments only**: No ending periods
- **Mixed or multiple sentences**: End periods for all items

## Examples

### Bulleted list (fragments)

**What documents and information do I need to apply?**

- Your Social Security number
- Your bank account direct deposit information
- Your education and military history
- Basic information about the school

### List with conjunctions

**Both of these descriptions must be true:**

- You have a current illness or injury affecting your mind or body, **and**
- You served on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training

### Multi-sentence items

Here's what you'll need to apply:

- **A Social Security number** for you, your spouse, and qualified dependents.
- **Your military discharge information.** If you sign in, we may fill this in automatically.

## Links in lists

- List items can be links in specific contexts
- Not all items require linking
- If all items link, keep under 7 items total
- Entire list item must be a link, not individual words
