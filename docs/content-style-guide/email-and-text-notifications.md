# Email and text notifications

Communications sent to Veterans regarding their interactions with VA—such as appointment reminders, form submission updates, and disability claim status—must be trustworthy, actionable, and comprehensible.

## General guidance

### Content standards

- Adhere to VA's plain language style guide principles
- Use "you" when addressing recipients and "we" when referring to VA
- Apply existing content patterns where applicable
- Reference the top 10 plain language standards
- Leverage VA Notify templates for form submission status emails

### Privacy protection

- Obtain privacy officer approval for all new or updated notifications
- Do not include Veterans' personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) in notifications
- Exception: PII/PHI may be included only with explicit Veteran opt-in and documented privacy officer approval

## Email notification specifications

### Subject lines

- **Length:** Maximum 9 words and 60 characters
- **Action-oriented emails:** Begin with action verbs
  - Example: "Review your dependent information for VA benefits"
- **Reminders/confirmations:** Use brief phrases
  - Example: "VA appointment reminder"
- **Post-submission failures:** Prefix with "Action needed"
  - Example: "Action needed: We couldn't process your VA form"

### Salutation and closing

- Personalize with first name only: "Dear ((first_name)),"
- Omit closing signature
- Do not include "Thank you for your service"

### Heading structure

- **H1:** Match subject line exactly or provide slightly expanded version
- **H2-H4:** Support content chunking and accessibility

### Primary action links

- Begin with action verbs; include purpose and destination
- Include "on VA.gov" when linking to VA website
- Example: "Submit your disability claim on VA.gov"
- Limit to one primary Action Link per email
- Avoid "Click here" phrasing
- Avoid generic terms like "Learn more" without context

### Secondary links

- Reserve for additional resources, FAQs, contact information
- Maximum 3 links per email body
- Apply general VA link guidance

### Formatting elements

**Bulleted lists:**
- Break up paragraph content
- Follow VA design system styling

**Bolded text:**
- Emphasize important information only
- Do not use for hierarchy (use headings instead)

**Dividers:**
- Create visual separation between topic changes
- Use to separate footer from main content
- Avoid between closely-positioned items

**Blockquote component:**
- Display confirmation numbers, appointment dates, key details
- Limit to one per email
- Align data field labels with confirmation screens
- Support Action Links within blockquotes

### Contact section

- Default heading: "Have questions?"
- Default content: "Visit va.gov or call 800-827-1000 (TTY: 711). We're here Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET"
- Customizable as needed
- Omit if already referenced in body content

### Footer

- Explain delivery reason and instruct against replies
- Example: "You're receiving this email because you submitted a form on VA.gov. Don't reply to this email."
