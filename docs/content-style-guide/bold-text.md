# Bold and italic text

Bold text draws attention to important words or phrases that help Veterans understand content.

## When to use bold

Appropriate uses include:

- **Setup lines before lists**: Text like "Both of these must be true" preceding bullet points
- **Conjunctions in lists**: The "and" or "or" at the end of bulleted items
- **Sentence openers**: First parts of sentences requiring emphasis for scannability, especially when describing different eligibility categories
- **Key numerals**: Dollar figures and numbers Veterans specifically seek
- **Account types**: References to "Login.gov, My HealtheVet, DS Logon, and ID.me"
- **Note/Example labels**: When introducing notes or examples
- **UI instructions**: Design elements or buttons users should select (e.g., "Select **File** menu")
- **Label-value pairs**: Labels in contact information sections, separated by line breaks

## When NOT to use bold

Avoid bolding in these situations:

- Text within hyperlinks (blue color and underlining provide sufficient distinction)
- Words emphasizing points (like "only if")
- Subheadings (use H3 or H4 tags instead for proper screen reader navigation)

## Punctuation rules

- **Introductory bold**: Bold the colon or period following it (e.g., "**Note:**")
- **Full sentences**: Bold all punctuation within and at the sentence end
- **Partial sentences**: Don't bold trailing punctuation outside the bolded phrase

## Italic text

:::warning
Avoid using italics entirely. Screen display quality and readability make italics problematic for web content.
