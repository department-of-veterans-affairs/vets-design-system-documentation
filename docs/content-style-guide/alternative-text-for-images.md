# Alternative text for images

Alternative text (also called "alt text") is a written substitute for a visual image on a screen.

## Purpose

Alt text ensures all users receive equivalent information regardless of how they access content. Key beneficiaries include:

- Individuals using screen readers who are blind or have low vision
- Users with low bandwidth who disable image loading
- Search engine optimization benefits

## When alt text is required

Provide alt text unless an image serves purely decorative purposes. Images require alt text when they:

- Convey important contextual information
- Function as clickable links directing to additional resources

## Five core guidelines for quality alt text

### 1. Describe meaningfully

Convey what viewers need to know from the visual, considering surrounding page context.

### 2. Stay concise

Aim for no more than 150 characters to maintain focus on essential details.

### 3. Avoid redundancy

Don't repeat information already present in nearby text.

### 4. Skip technical descriptors

Omit phrases like "image of" or "photo of" since screen readers already identify graphics.

### 5. Exclude file names

File names provide no useful information and create confusion.

## Privacy considerations

:::warning Critical restriction
Don't include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI) in alt text for interactive images.
:::

**Rationale:** Interactive image interactions are logged in analytics systems, risking exposure of sensitive information.

**Example scenario:** X-ray images labeled with specific body parts and injuries expose PHI through alt text and analytics tracking.
