Use this pattern when you need to collect a mailing or home address, including military base addresses. Usage When to use this pattern Collecting mailing addresses. When you need a user's mailing location for correspondence.Collecting home addresses. When you need a user's residential address.Collecting military base addresses. When users may be located at military installations. Design principles Validate against USPS data. Compare entries against postal service databases and warn users of discrepancies.Adapt fields by country. State field converts from text input to select menu for US, Canada, and Mexico.Use prefill when available. Populate from VA.gov profile and notify users with the prefill component.Clarify profile updates. Specify whether changes affect the user's broader VA.gov profile. Examples Mailing address Standard form for collecting a mailing address with street, city, state, and postal code fields. Military base address Form variant including military installation checkbox and APO/FPO options. Address confirmation Alert component warning of unmatched USPS data with correction options. How to design and build The address pattern uses a structured workflow for both single and multiple address scenarios. How this pattern works Header identifying address type (mailing or home address).Contextual information block explaining why the address is needed.Military address checkbox with explanation (conditional).Country selector dropdown.Three-line street address fields.City input field.State/Province/Region field (adapts based on country).Postal code input with country-specific validation.For home address: 'Same as mailing address' radio option. Components used in this pattern CheckboxSelectText inputAlert Code usage Usage The `addressPattern` is available as a web-component pattern in the VA Forms library. ```jsx import { addressPattern } from '@department-of-veterans-affairs/platform-forms-system/patterns'; ``` See the [vets-website repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website) for implementation details.

Asking for one logical thing at a time allows users to focus on what you are asking from them. While a page may contain multiple form fields, the &quot;one thing&quot; refers to the information being gathered conceptually. Usage When to use this pattern Collecting related responses. When collecting one or a few related responses from users.Reducing complexity. When dividing long forms into logical sections.Focused information gathering. When situations require clear, focused questions. Design principles One thing per page. This encompasses: one piece of information, one decision, or one question.Limit conditional reveals. When using conditional reveals, limit to one per page.Make revealed questions clear. Conditionally revealed questions should be self-explanatory.Create distinct error messages. Each field should have its own error message. When not to use this pattern Multiple similar items. When collecting the same data about multiple items, use the Multiple Responses pattern.Unknown quantity. When gathering an unknown quantity of responses, use the Multiple Responses pattern. Examples Single question page Page with one focused question and clear call to action. Related fields grouped Multiple fields that together represent one logical concept (e.g., full address). How to design and build Design forms using the &quot;one thing per page&quot; principle. How this pattern works Brainstorm concepts using sticky notes to identify individual 'things'.Assume each concept belongs on separate pages initially.Conduct card sorting exercises with teams to group related items.Research how concepts link in existing solutions.Reorganize into related groupings where appropriate.Map user flow and test with actual users.Iterate based on feedback. Components used in this pattern CheckboxMemorable dateRadio buttonSelectText inputTextarea Code usage Usage The single response pattern reduces cognitive load, simplifies error handling, improves mobile experiences, and enhances screen reader compatibility. **Production examples:** - VA Form 21-0972 (Alternate Signer) - VA Form 21-10210 (Lay/Witness Statement) - VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim) - VA Form 20-10206 (FOIA/Privacy Act Request) Content considerations Focus each page on one logical concept, even if it contains multiple form fields.Use clear, concise questions that don't require additional context.Provide helpful hint text only when necessary. Accessibility considerations The W3C notes that keeping content to a small number of important points reduces clutter and aids understanding.This benefits users with cognitive disabilities who may struggle with focus and information retention.Ensure keyboard accessibility for conditionally revealed fields.Provide clear focus management when revealing additional fields.

VA asks users of VA.gov for feedback via a feedback button and form provided by Medallia, enabling sentiment feedback collection across modernized pages. Usage When to use this pattern Every modernized VA.gov page. Consistently offer feedback capability on every modernized page.Page bottom placement. Position the feedback button at the bottom of the page, alongside other footer-area elements. Design principles Consistent placement. The feedback button should appear in the same location on every page.Coordinate with other elements.

Examples Desktop feedback button Feedback button at the bottom of content on full-width and search results pages. Mobile feedback button Feedback button accessible on mobile viewports.

How this pattern works Position the Medallia feedback button at the bottom of main content.Coordinate placement with back-to-top button and last-updated date when present.Maintain consistent spacing regardless of which elements are present.Trigger modal form on button click.Display confirmation screen post-submission and return focus to button. Components used in this pattern ButtonBack to top Code usage Usage The feedback pattern is powered by Medallia integration. **Research findings:** - Moving button from sidebar to main content increased submissions 84-1,280% across tested pages - 54-60% of participants looked in footer first when searching for feedback options See the Medallia integration documentation for implementation details. Accessibility considerations Previous sticky sidebar placement created 508 compliance issues; relocation to main content resolved accessibility barriers.The button must be keyboard accessible.Focus must return to the button after the modal is closed.Screen magnification users may miss bottom-placed buttons, but research showed this is still the preferred location.
