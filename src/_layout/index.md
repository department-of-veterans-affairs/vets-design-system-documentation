## Grids

We have two types of grids. One is the float grid (whereas "float" refers to the `float` CSS property) provide by the U.S. Web Design System.  The other grid is a flexbox grid (which refers to the `flexbox` CSS spec) that provides more design flexibility and options to use with responsive design. A similar flexbox grid will be offered in the U.S Web Design System version 2.0.
