# Layout

<div class="va-introtext">
You will find everything you need to build out the structure of a page on VA.gov or scaffold content or components within one in the layout section.
</div>

## Grids

We have two types of grids. One is the float grid (whereas "float" refers to the `float` CSS property) provide by the U.S. Web Design System.  The other grid is a flexbox grid (which refers to the `flexbox` CSS spec) that provides more design flexibility and options to use with responsive design. A similar flexbox grid will be offered in the U.S. Web Design System version 2.0.
