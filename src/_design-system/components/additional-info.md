# Additional Info

AdditionalInfo components are interactive components that reveal and hide content from the page.

<div class="site-c-showcase">
{% include_relative html/additional-info.html %}
</div>

```html
{% include  react/AdditionalInfo.njk %}
```

## Examples

You can see the Additional Info component on the Health Care Application form:
- [Deductible Expenses page](https://vets.gov/health-care/apply/application/household-information/deductible-expenses)
- [Medicare information page](https://vets.gov/health-care/apply/application/insurance-information/medicare)

To see those pages, you would need to fill out the first few chapters of the form. (Note: We can update these links with examples that are earlier in a form or outside a form flow so they are easier to see.)
