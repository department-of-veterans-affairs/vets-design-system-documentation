**Note:** These guidelines don’t apply to inline error messages in form fields (for example, “Enter a valid Social Security number”).

## How to structure an error message

### Step 1. Explain what went wrong
- In a standard alert style, explain the problem in the header. (In a slim alert style without a header, this will be in the main text). [Go to alert styles](https://design.va.gov/components/alert)
- If we caused the error, say “We’re sorry.” For example, “We’re sorry. There’s a problem with our system. We can’t access your records right now.”
- If the person doing the action caused the error, don’t say “we’re sorry.” But don’t blame the person. Use a neutral tone to describe the problem. For example, “We can’t upload this file type. Try uploading a .pdf or .doc file instead.”

### Step 2. Explain how to fix it (recovery step)
- After you explain the error, tell the person how to fix it. Include as many recovery steps as you need to make sure the person won’t get stuck in a dead end.
- If the error is likely to resolve on its own, use “Try again” or “Check back later” as the first step.
- If the first recovery step is something the person needs to do, provide a contact option as the second recovery step. For example, “If it still doesn’t work, call us at [number].”
- Make sure the recovery steps are clear, specific, and actionable. 
  - **Like this:** “We can’t upload this file type. Upload a .pdf or .doc file instead.”
  - **Not this:** “Invalid file type.”
- You can include a link or button in the error message, if needed to complete the recovery step.

## Contact options for VA error messages
These are some of the most common contact options we provide in error messages. Some errors may need a more specific contact option. 

You can add conditional statements before these recovery steps as needed. For example:
- If you need more help, …
- If it still doesn’t work, …
- If you have questions about your VA benefits, …

**Note:** When you create a new error message with a contact option, you’ll need to coordinate with the Veteran Support team. Tell that team what triggers the error, what the recovery steps are, and how contact center staff can help people troubleshoot or resolve the problem. If you’re launching a new product, you can include this information in the product guide. Otherwise, you can contact the Veteran Support team via this Slack channel: vsp-contact-center-support.
