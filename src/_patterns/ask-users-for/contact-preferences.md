## Usage

### When to use this pattern

* **When needed and you would like to offer a method of contact.** Method of contact is form-dependent. Work with your stakeholders on whether your form needs a method of contact.

## Examples

![contact information method of contact template]({{site.baseurl}}/images/patterns/ask-users-for/contact-preferences/method-of-contact.png)

## How to design and build

### How this pattern works

* **Give users the opportunity to pick one method of contact.** Provide contact information methods in radio button list form.
