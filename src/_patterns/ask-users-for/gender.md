## Usage

### When to use this pattern

- **Donâ€™t ask if it does not benefit the user experience.** You should only ask users about gender when absolutely necessary.  

**Note:** Many forms are based off of paper forms with limited fields for gender. Work with your stakeholder to expand the fields. 

## Examples

![applicant information gender template]({{site.baseurl}}/images/patterns/ask-users-for/gender/gender.png)

## How to design and build 

### How this pattern works

- **Give Veterans the option of picking more than one gender they could identify with.** Always use checkboxes so that Veterans can identify with multiple descriptions.
* **Provide a way to self-describe.** Selecting this checkbox should reveal a text field that allows the Veteran to use their own preferred terminology.
* **Provide a way to opt-out of answering.** A checkbox labeled "Prefer not to answer" should be provided.
