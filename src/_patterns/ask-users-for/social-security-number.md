## Usage

### When to use this pattern

* **When you need to collect a person's Social Security or VA file number.** For example, for an application for identity purposes.

## Examples

{% include component-example.html alt="Shows the form fields used to obtain Social Security number and VA file number." file="/images/patterns/ask-users-for/social-security-number/form-ssn.png" caption="Example of asking for a Social security or VA file number." class="x2" %}

## How to design and build

### How this pattern works

A Social Security Number (SSN) consists of nine digits, commonly written as three fields separated by hyphens: AAA-GG-SSSS. The first three-digit field is called the "area number". The central, two-digit field is called the "group number". The final, four-digit field is called the "serial number".

A VA file number is how a Veteran’s claim is tracked through the compensation system and how documents and other evidence are associated with a Veteran’s file in the VA’s electronic database.

* **Use the [web-component-patterns/ssnPattern in the Forms Library]( {{ page.code-link }}).**

The ssnPattern implements the following:

* **Use a single text input for each field.**
* **Do not abbreviate.** Use ‘Social Security number’. Do not use abbreviations, such as SSN.
* **When asking for both Social Security and VA file numbers, one or the other may be provided.** VA file numbers are not on every form.If the form asks for a Social Security number and VA file number make sure to note in the VA file number label or helper text, "must have this or a Social Security number".
* **Give user flexibility in entering their Social Security number.** A user can enter the Social Security number however they like: with spaces, without spaces, dashes, or without dashes. When the user enters their number and the input loses focus, the number will appear masked with dashes. 
* **Validate Social Security numbers.** See [content considerations](#content-considerations) for the appropriate validation messages.
