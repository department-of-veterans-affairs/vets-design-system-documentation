## Usage

### When to use this pattern

* **When you need to collect a phone number.** For example, for contact information.

## Examples

### U.S. phone numbers

{% include component-example.html alt="Shows the form fields used to obtain home phone number and mobile phone number." file="/images/patterns/ask-users-for/phone-numbers/phone-numbers.png" caption="Example of asking for a home phone number or mobile phone number." class="x2" %}

## How to design and build

### Layout details

### How this pattern works

* **If possible, tell users why you want their phone number.** An example message is: *Please enter your contact information so we can get in touch with you if we have questions about your application.* This message can be at the top of the page if asking for any other contact information.
* **Validate phone numbers.** Users must provide at least a 10 digit phone number with or without dashes for U.S. phone numbers and up to a 15-digit phone number for international phone numbers. 

  Example of acceptable formats for U.S. phone numbers:
  * 703-123-4567
  * 7031234567

  Example of acceptable formats for international phone numbers:
  * +52 123 456-7890
  * 637031234567

* **If a user chooses a home or mobile phone number as their method of contact, phone numbers are required fields.** If a user chooses email or mail as their preferred method then a phone number field won’t be validated. (Note: Method of contact field is form dependent)
* **“Mobile phone number” is a required field if the user checks (I would like to receive text messages from VA about my [  ] benefits).** An example of this is on the [VA Form 22-10203 (Application for Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship)](https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/stem-scholarship/apply-for-scholarship-form-22-10203/introduction)
* **Pair with email address.** Collection of phone numbers is paired with [email address]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/ask-users-for/email-address). The two patterns typically appear on the same step/page.

### Components used in this pattern

* [Text input]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form/text-input)

### Page templates available for this pattern

Use the [VADS templates (Patterns & Forms) for Names in Figma]({{ page.figma-link }}).

## Code usage

[phonePattern is a web-component pattern available in the Forms library]({{ page.code-link }}).

## Content considerations

* **Do not use primary or secondary phone numbers as field labels.** Home and mobile phone numbers are more plain language-focused.
* **Display phone numbers in the appropriate way.** If you need to display a phone number after it has been collected, then [follow content style guidelines on phone numbers]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers#phone-numbers).

### Labels, error messages, and hint text

{% include _field-labels.html labels=site.data.content.patterns.ask-users-for.phone-numbers %}
