## Usage

### When to use this pattern

- **Don’t ask if it does not benefit the user experience.** Only collect users’ information on this topic if you are going to use the data. 

## Examples

![applicant information race template]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Applicant-info-race.png) 

## How to design and build 

### How this pattern works

* **Give users the option of picking more than one ethnic group.** Always use checkboxes so that users can identify with multiple ethnicities. 
* **Provide a way to opt-out of answering.** A checkbox labeled "Prefer not to answer" should be provided.
