## Usage

### When to use this pattern

* **When you need to collect a person's name.** For example, for contact information or to complete an application.

**Note:** These fields are not on every form. Work with your stakeholders to determine which fields are necessary for your application.

## Examples

{% include component-example.html alt="Shows the form fields used to obtain first, middle, and last name." file="/images/patterns/ask-users-for/names/form-names.png" caption="Example of asking for first, middle, and last names." class="x2" %}

<a class="vads-c-action-link--blue" href="{{ page.example-link }}">

## How to design and build

### How this pattern works

The names pattern implements the following:

* **First name and last name are required fields.** Optional fields include:
  * Middle name
  * Suffix
  * Motherâ€™s maiden name
* **Make sure name fields work for most veterans.** Fields must be long enough to accommodate the names of your users. Do not restrict the types of characters users can enter in any of these fields. Names can include characters outside the standard Roman alphabet.
* **Pair with date of birth.** Collection of full name is paired with [date of birth]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/ask-users-for/dates). The two patterns typically appear on the same step/page.

### Components used in this pattern

* [Select]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form/select) for suffix, when necessary
* [Text input]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form/text-input)
