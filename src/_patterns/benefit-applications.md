# Benefit applications

Applications must consist of four epics

1. Eligibility
2. How to Apply
3. Apply now
4. After you apply

## Eligibilty
- Purpose of the form - plain language explanation
- wizards - disambiguate the form, help you figure out if you are actually eligible.
- prerequisite - what you need to be eligible
- Green button
- Check your status (where would i look for it on the page? / prevent submitting twice)


## How to apply
- Intro statement - how to apply, SEO
- Important info box - chunked, scannable snippets of critical info
- Structure - what goes above or below the button
- List different methods to apply - path that's most advantageous to the Veteran.
- How to get help info from a human
- Expectation setting
- FAQ about applying at bottom of the page
- Green button
- Check your status (where would i look for it on the page? / prevent submitting twice)

We should note that it could have some overlap with eligibility or apply now

## After you apply
- Intro statement - plain language next step.
  - It's the immediate next step.
  - Nothing critical should only be there. Still make SEO friendly.
- How long will it take?
- Subway map, communicate the macro process
- Expectation settings
- Communicate major actions user may need to take next
- Additional questions for after you apply

## Apply Now
- OMB equivalency statement
  - This can be multiple
- Info alert / sign in to save progress
  - [sign in prompt](sign-in-prompt)
  - What content goes in
  - document what this looks like signed in as well
- Check your status (where would i look for it on the page? / prevent submitting twice)
- Subway map - steps to apply
- Green button - start application
- OMB control pattern (on every page of the form?)
  - Respondent burden
  - OMB control numer
  - Privacy act (link)
- Need help number
- Check your status (where would i look for it on the page? / prevent submitting twice)
- Link to [form design](forms) pattern thing (however that gets defined)

## Waivers
- Tend to be later in the flow before reviews
- Lot of legal copy. Can be a static page on VA.gov that we link to. Lot of TL;DR version on the action application
- One question at a time.

## Service history
Review of information type of pattern versus information collection. Veterans need to very if period of service is missing or incorrect.

- Data is typically pre-filled for login
- Show stack of flats (eg. Branch, Date)
- May have other info (eg. character of discharge) but we hide that in the "review" view.
