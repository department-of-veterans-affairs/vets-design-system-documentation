## About

This is a standardized template for all pages (besides the introduction, review, and confirmation page) of an online form that ask Veterans to enter information, select an answer option, or upload supporting documents. Within Figma, the placeholder section of the form step page template is the primary section of the page that you replace with a common form pattern or a custom local component. 

Note for designers using the form step template in Figma: You can replace the placeholder with only a single component. You may need to create a custom local Figma component made of  multiple design system components or patterns.

### Variations
There are two versions of the form step page: 
- Authenticated
-   Includes a header design showing the logged in state
-   Includes a prefill information alert near the top of the page that explains to a user that certain information can be prefilled because they are signed in to va.gov. This alert should only appear on pages where information has been prefilled.
-   Includes a text area message above the prefill alert notifying a user that their application is saved automatically and provides an ID number.
-   Includes a success alert that reiterates when the form autosaves with a timestamp. This success alert only appears after a user interacts with a field. But for design purposes we show it static on all Figma pages.
- Unauthenticated
-   No authenticated header
-   No prefill alert
-   No autosave messaging

## Example - Authenticated

{% include component-example.html alt="An example of form step page for authenticated users." file="/images/templates/forms/form-step/1-example-auth.png" caption="Anatomy of the form step page for authenticated users." class="x2" %}

The authenticated form step page template consists of:
1. Breadcrumb
2. Page title and subtitle
3. Progress bar - segmented (includes step header)
4. Saved as message with application ID
5. Prefill alert
6. Form step content (includes page title)
7. Finish this application later link
8. Button pair (Back/Continue)
9. Autosave alert

## Example - Unauthenticated

{% include component-example.html alt="An example of a form step page for unauthenticated users." file="/images/templates/forms/form-step/2-example-unauth.png" caption="Anatomy of the Review page for unauthenticated users." class="x2" %}

The unauthenticated form step page template consists of:
1. Breadcrumb
2. Page title and subtitle
3. Progress bar - segmented (includes step header)
4. Form step content (includes page title)
7. Finish this application later link
8. Button pair (Back/Continue)
9. Need help?

## Structure

### Breadcrumb
The breadcrumb will remain static across all form step pages for a single form. [Learn more about expected breadcrumb behavior in the design system]{https://design.va.gov/components/breadcrumbs}. We recommend that designers create a breadcrumb local component in Figma to insert into the form step template rather than manually updating each form step template page individually.

### Page title and subtitle

Use the same H1 page title and subtitle as the form introduction, review, and confirmation pages. [Review the form introduction template for page title and subtitle for more guidance and examples]{https://design.va.gov/templates/forms/introduction#structure}. We recommend that designers create a page title and subtitle local component in Figma to insert into the form step template rather than manually updating each form step template page individually.

### Progress bar & overall form step structure

Use the [progress bar - segmented component]{https://design.va.gov/templates/forms/introduction#structure} to organize form steps. 

The name for each step is called the “step header.” The way you organize the form steps will also impact the “page title” (the H3 that begins the form content section), pattern, and content. Because of limitations on the progress bar UI, we recommend limiting all forms to 13 steps total.

If your form contains conditionals, you may need multiple versions of the progress bar to cover all the possible paths (sometimes called user stories) that a user might take through a form. We recommend that designers create a progress bar local component in Figma for each possible path rather than manually updating each form step template page individually.

#### Form step content structure
This part of the template shows how to order and group form patterns (like name and date of birth) into steps. It also shows how to format page titles within those steps. This is not a list of required steps and pages for all forms. Each form will be different. 

Create the steps and pages that match the requirements for your form. Whenever possible, use existing patterns and standardized content from the design system for those patterns.

#### Step header and page title
The step header (found within the progress bar) should usually have different content than the page title. The step header will be the general type of information we’re collecting (like “personal information”) and the page title will be the more specific information we’re collecting (like “name and date of birth”).

{% include component-example.html alt="Screenshot of form page distinguishing that the step header and page title should have different content." file="/images/templates/forms/form-step/3-step-header-page-title.png" caption="Distinguishing an example of when the step header and page title should have different content" class="x2" %}

Use the step header and the page title to specify the role of the form submitter. For example, use “your” only when referring to the form submitter. If that could be a different person than the Veteran or a non-Veteran claimant, the step header and page title content are important tools to help the form submitter understand when we’re asking for their information versus another person’s information. 

Identifying within your form’s information architecture who the form submitter is and which pages are asking for their information will also allow you to more easily leverage prefilled information since, as of right now, someone can only be logged in to va.gov as themselves. 

{% include component-example.html alt="Screenshot side-by-sides of form screenshots  showing how to leverage the step header and page title for different form submitter roles." file="/images/templates/forms/form-step/4-side-by-side.png" caption="This side-by-sides of form screenshots shows how to leverage the step header and page title for different form submitter roles." class="x2" %}

It’s an information architecture best practice to ask for the information that’s easiest for the form submitter to recall. This will reduce form abandonment. So always ask for the form submitter’s information (“your information”) first, using “Your” in step and page titles.

### Saved as message with application ID
Text area notifying a user that their application is saved automatically and provides an application ID number.
### Form step content
Insert customized form step content in this section of the form step page. Consult the form step structure guidance above and the One thing per page design principle to determine how much form content to fit onto a single page.

Some components may include the option to add body text, hint text, or additional information. Use these guidelines to decide which one to use. 
#### Body text
Use body text to add clarifying information that is relevant to all the information under a page title. The body text should either clarify what type of information we need, or explain what we’re going to do with the data. Aim for fewer than fifty words in the body text. If you need more space, consider moving nonessential information to an additional info component. 
#### Hint text
Add hint text under a field label if it would help someone choose the right response to give–like “We’ll use your email address to confirm when we receive your form” since knowing how we’ll use their email may help them choose which email to enter. Or use hint text to help someone answer a question more easily–like “For example: January 1, 2001”. Don’t use punctuation in hint text unless the copy is two sentences or more.  
#### Field label text (also called legend)
On form step pages with only one question, the page title could be the field label for a checkbox or radio group. For these components, there’s no need to add an additional field label if it doesn’t add meaning beyond what’s in the page title. For example “Are you filling this form out for yourself or someone else?” is both page title and field label.

{% include component-example.html alt="Figma annotations distinguishing a page title and field label from the fieldset for a radio button set." file="/images/templates/forms/form-step/7-label-title.png" caption="Figma annotations distinguishing a page title and field label from the fieldset for a radio button set." class="x2" %}

#### Additional information
Use the additional information component if there’s relevant information that may be important for some people, but it’s not critical information for everyone filling out the form. Review guidelines for using the additional information component. 
### Finish this application later link
A link that allows the user to exit the process with their progress saved.
### Button pair
Button pair contains a secondary button labeled “Back” and primary button labeled “Continue”. On the last form step page, change “Continue” to “Submit”.
### Autosave alert
The Autosave component provides the last saved date and time in a Alert - background only - Success variation. A related line of text just under the step header also tells users that we’ll save their form after every change. This only shows to authenticated users.
### Need help?
The Need help? component appears on the bottom of every page of the form. This content tells users how to get additional help with the form or contact VA about their related benefits. You can customize the content for the specific form.
