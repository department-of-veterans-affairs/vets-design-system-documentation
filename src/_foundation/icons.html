<h2 id="requesting-a-new-icon">Requesting a new icon</h2>
<p>
  If your team needs a new icon and wants to suggest adding it to the design system, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Check Existing VADS Icons</strong>:
    Look through the current icon set to ensure a similar icon does not already exist. We aim to maintain consistency in
    semantic use by avoiding duplicating similar icons.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Explore USWDS Icons</strong>:
      Search
      <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/icon/">USWDS Icon</a> to see if another existing icon suits your
      needs. Preferably, choose generic icons that could be reused in various applications.

      <p>If VADS and USWDS do not contain a suitable icon, you
        may search <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons">Material
          Icons</a> or browse the official <a
          href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1014241558898418245/material-design-icons">Material Design Icons</a>
        Figma
        plugin by Google. Note that we typically use the "filled" icon style.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Submit Your Icon</strong>:
    Once you've found a suitable icon for VADS, submit it using the following link:
    <p><a class="vads-c-action-link--blue" href="{{ site.request_addition_link }}">Request a new addition to the Design
        System</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These steps should streamline the process for suggesting and adding new icons to the design system.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-considerations">Accessibility considerations</h2>
<p>
  Icon usage typically falls into two categories, decorative and semantic.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Decorative icons</strong> are icons that are only used for visual reinforcement. If these were removed from the page, users would still be able to
  understand and use the page.</li>
  <li><strong>Semantic icons</strong> are icons that convey meaning, rather than only being decorative. This includes icons without text next to them that are
  used as interactive elements such as buttons.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="decorative-icons">Using decorative icons</h3>
<p>
  If your icons are only decorative, _do not_ include <code>srtext</code> on the component. The component will add an <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute to the icon for accessibility.
</p>

<p>Icon buttons containing a decorative icon plus a visual label are supported with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/components/button-icon">Button - Icon</a>, but with limited options. Rather than supporting any text and icon combination, these will be added on a case-by-case basis. Generally, we feel that icons in buttons are not necessary.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-icons">Using semantic icons</h3>
<p>
  We do not advise using icons as links or buttons on their own. Links and buttons should always have a visible label.
</p>

<p>
  Exceptions to this are a close button on a modal or an alert. However, it is advised to use the design system component for these scenarios, as they are coded with the proper accessibility attributes.
