* In all cases, only show error validation messages or stylings after a user has interacted with a particular field.
* The form field and its corresponding `<label>` are wrapped in a container which provides a thick border and padding to visual indicate an error message to users who might have difficulty perceiving contrast. It also changes the border of the input to red as a secondary indicator.
* An error message is placed between the label and the form field.
* The form field receives an `aria-describedby` attribute that references the `id` of the error message.
* Prepending `<span class="sr-only">Error</span>` to error messages alerts screen screen readers clearly that an error exists.
