When a new page loads in a form application, move focus to an element that gives users context and helps them find the next action. Use these guidelines to choose the best focus location:

* **If the page has a unique page heading**, set focus there. The unique heading is usually an H1 at the top of the page or H3 inside the step content.
* **If the page does not have a unique page heading**, set focus on the step indicator header. This header is usually an H2.
* **When users navigate back to a form page**, treat it like a fresh page load and move focus to the top unique heading.
