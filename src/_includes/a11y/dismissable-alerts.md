* Manage focus after the {{ include.component }} is dismissed. When a user dismisses the {{ include.component }}, it disappears from the page structure. If a keyboard or screen reader user closes the {{ include.component }}, they will lose focus and in some browsers, this can return the user to the top of the page. To prevent this, move focus to the next logical spot, such as the next heading after the {{ include.component }} or the main heading `h1`, depending on what the user needs to do next.
