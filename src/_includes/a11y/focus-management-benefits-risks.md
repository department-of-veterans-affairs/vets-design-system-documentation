### Benefits of focus management

* **Moving focus can help users understand where they are.** When a new element receives focus, screen readers announce it, giving users immediate context about their location.
* **Managing focus can bring users closer to the next relevant action.** Moving focus to the right location can make it easier for users to find information and complete tasks.

### Risks of focus management

* **Moving focus can be disorienting for the user.** If a user is already interacting with the page, moving focus can be disruptive and confusing. Only manage focus when it’s needed.
* **Moving focus can disrupt other screen reader announcements.** Since newly focused elements tend to be prioritized in screen reader announcements, focus management can prevent aria-live from announcing as expected.
