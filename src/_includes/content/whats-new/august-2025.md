#### [Dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers)
Added an exception to time zone formatting for automated time stamps:

> For automated time stamps from the time library used in vets-website (date-fns), the time zone uses the 3-letter format (ex. EDT).

#### [Links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links)

- Revised guidance on inline/embedded links:<br>
> In general, put a link on a separate line to help it stand out. Have a case where you think an inline link might be necessary due to space limitations? Contact the centralized content team for help with your content.
- Fixed broken link to the Links component page.

#### [Numbers, signs, and symbols](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/numbers)

- Changed the page title to **Numbers, signs, and symbols**
- Added the ampersand information (moved from the **Punctuation** page; no changes to the guidance)
- Clarified that there are no spaces around degree symbols or percent signs
- Revised the guidance on using "1" versus "one" to only use "one" with certain expressions:
> Spell out "one" when it's used in expressions like one-to-one, one-on-one, one-time, and "one of the reasonsâ€¦" Use the numeral "1" for all other instances.
- Made edits to the rest of the page to align with our style (these edits don't affect guidance)

#### [Punctuation](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/punctuation)

- Removed the information on ampersands (moved this to the **Numbers, signs, and symbols** page)
- Added an exception for using quotes when referring to buttons, section titles, etc. if the text is already bold:
> **Note:** If the text is already bold (like in some error messages), we can use quotation marks to reference buttons, screens, or section headers.
- Made edits to the rest of the page to align with our style (these edits don't affect guidance)
