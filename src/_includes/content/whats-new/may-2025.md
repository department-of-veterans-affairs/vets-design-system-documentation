#### [Destigmatizing language for weight](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/health-content/destigmatizing-language-for-weight)

Added this new page to the **Health content** section in the content style guide

#### [Neutral language](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/neutral-language)

Revised guidance to match our current practices of using "select" instead of "click," "tap," etc.:

> People can use several different types of interactions for the same task. So, we use "select" instead of "click," "press," or "tap."<p>
Examples:<p>
• In buttons, use "Select **Submit**" instead of "Tap the **Submit** button"<br>
• In links and navigation, use "Select **My VA**" instead of "Click on **My VA**"<br>
• In phone extensions, use "Select 1" instead of "Press 1"<br>
• In step-by-step instructions, use "Select **Save**" instead of "Click **Save**"

#### [Word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list)

Added and revised entries:

> **click:** Avoid using "click" and "click here." Instead, follow these formats:<br>
    • Link the entire call to action where relevant, like this: [Find an accredited representative to help you](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp)<br>
    • Use "select" to point someone to a specific place in the UI, like this: In your account dashboard, select **Profile**<br>

> **delete:** Use the word "delete" instead of "remove." For example, "Delete file."<br>

> **upload:** Use the word "upload" instead of "add." For example, "Upload file" and "Upload another file."<br>

#### [Error messages - Feedback](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/error-messages/feedback) and [Writing for SEO](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/seo)

Removed instances of "click" on these pages and changed to "select."

#### [Links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links)

-	Added information on why we put links on their own line instead of using embedded links:<br>
> Too many embedded links can be distracting or overwhelming to people with traumatic brain injuries or other cognitive impairments. We put links on their own line to help make the page easier to scan and the intention of the link as clear as possible.
-	Clarified guidance about links opening in a new tab (this should only happen under specific circumstances, explained in Components):<br>
> **Note:** If a link needs to open in a new tab, add "(opens in a new tab)" to notify users. Don't use the new window icon unless there are space constraints.<br>
[Review guidance on when to open links in a new tab in the Components section](https://design.va.gov/components/link/)

#### [Punctuation](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/punctuation)

Added guidance on using punctuation with quotation marks:<br>
> Periods and commas go inside the quotation marks, even if they're not part of the quoted text. All other punctuation (em dashes, question marks, colons, parentheses) go outside the quotation marks unless they're part of the quoted text.

#### [Bold & italic text](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bold-text)

Added guidance on when to bold punctuation:

> **Punctuation with bold text**<br>
**For punctuation following bold text:**<br>
•	If the bold text is an introduction, the colon or period following it should also be bold (ex. the colon after "**Note:**" or the period after a list item introduction, "**Be concise.** Use as few words as possible…").<br>
•	If the bold text is a full sentence, bold any punctuation within or at the end of the sentence.<br>
•	If the bold text is only part of a sentence, don't bold punctuation that isn't part of the bolded phrase (ex. "Select **Continue**, then answer the remaining questions)."

#### [Dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers)

-	Added guidance on how to write date ranges:<br>
> Write out date ranges using sentence construction in body copy: This will be available from December 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025.<br>
**Note:** Be intentional when picking "from/to," "from/through," or "between/and" for date ranges. Each option can mean different things, so pick the option that best matches your needs.
-	Added guidance on commas after dates:<br>
> Add a comma after the year when using the full construction, unless the date is the end of the sentence. If the date is at the end of the sentence, use the punctuation you'd normally use (period, question mark, colon, no punctuation).

### Components

#### [Link](https://design.va.gov/components/link/)

Clarified guidance on when links can open in a new tab (only under specific circumstances):

> **Open links in the same window, with exceptions.** Links on VA.gov should open in a new tab only if clicking the link will cause the user to lose progress or data. This should be avoided when possible. In all other cases, links should open in the same window.<br>
