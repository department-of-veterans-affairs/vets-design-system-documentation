### Content style guide

#### [Bulleted and numbered lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bulleted-lists)

- Made edits to the **Considerations** section to align with current style guide guidance
- Added an example and guidance for using "or" at the beginning of a list item:
  > **Example of non-eligibility-related bulleted list with “or” at the beginning of the list item**<p>
  In some cases, you may need to add “or” to the beginning of the list item. For example, with list items that have 2 or more sentences, the conjunction may work better at the beginning of the second list item than at the end of the first.<p>
  **Note:** This guidance only applies to lists that use “or.”

#### [Payments and debts](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/specific-topics-and-programs/payments-and-debts)
Updated the definitions for these terms:

- **copay (or copayment, or health care copay):** We use this term to describe the amount some Veterans pay for certain health care services and prescriptions. On first mention, include a plain language definition. For example, “You may need to pay a copay for outpatient care for conditions not related to your military service. A copay is a fixed amount you owe for the service.”<br>
**Note:** Use “health care copay” on first mention in general content where the context of health care is necessary and then “copay” on subsequent mentions.
- **copay bill (or patient statement, or billing statement):** We use these terms to describe the bill or statement that a Veteran receives for their health care copay. On first mention, include a plain language definition. For example, “You may get a copay bill (or “statement”) for the amount you owe for health care services that aren’t exempt from copays.”
- **debt:** We use this term as the overarching term for any money the Veteran owes to VA. “Debt” encompasses money owed for overpayments as well as copays. If the debt is because of an overpayment or a copay, we should use those terms to explain why the Veteran owes money.
- **overpayment or overpayment debt:** We use this term to refer to a debt that’s because of an overpayment. In some cases, we can go with “overpayments” (and not add “overpayment debts”).
- **waiver (debt forgiveness):** Include “(debt forgiveness)” on first mention. We use this term to describe a debt repayment or relief option in which a Veteran asks VA to forgive (or “waive”) part or all of a debt.<br>
**Note:** Waivers are a debt repayment or relief option for both benefit overpayment and copay debt. Other options include compromise offers, monthly offsets (overpayment debt only), monthly repayment plans, waivers, and write-offs (copay debt only).

#### [Punctuation and formatting](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/punctuation)

- Added formatting information to the section
- Updated the section title to include formatting
- Added guidance on note and form field error message formatting:
  > **Notes**<p>
    • Place notes on their own line directly after the text the note applies to.<br>
    • Capitalize and bold “**Note:**”.<br>
    • If a note applies to only 1 item in a list, place the note directly after that specific list item (not after the full list). Use a soft return (shift + enter on PCs, shift + return on Macs) so the note appears on a separate line, aligned with the list indent, with no space between the lines. Don’t make the note its own bullet or sub-bullet.

  > **Error messages in form fields**<p>
    • Make error messages for form fields sentence case and bold<br>
    • Don’t place a period after the error message unless it has 2 or more sentences<br>
    • In most cases, start error messages with a verb, like “Enter” (for text fields) or “Select” (for radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus)<br>
    • If an error message references a specific checkbox, radio button, etc., use quotation marks

#### [Error and alert messages](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/error-messages/)

- Updated the section title to include "alert" and added "alert" throughout the page where needed
- Made style guide edits throughout to match current guidance
- Added guidance on heading/title length:
  > **Error and alert message titles**<p>
When possible, keep error and alert message titles (headings) to 50 characters, including spaces. Error and alert message titles should follow the general guidelines for page and section titles.<p>
