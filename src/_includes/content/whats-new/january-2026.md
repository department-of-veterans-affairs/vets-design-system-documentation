Removed this section. The guidance is available in the [Use conversational language](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/plain-language/use-conversational-language) section.

Removed this section. The guidance is available in the [Neutral language](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/neutral-language) section.

#### [Sign in and identity verification](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/specific-topics-and-programs/sign-in-and-identity-verification)

- Changed the order of accounts in the text so **ID.me** comes before **Login.gov**.
- Removed the guidance to emphasize using **Login.gov**.
- Revised the guidance explaining that **ID.me** and **Login.gov** are accounts and not separate tools:
  > Research has shown that some people confuse **Login.gov** with being a separate tool, and some people think they need to go to the **ID.me** or **Login.gov** websites to sign in rather than VA.gov. So, we reinforce that **ID.me** and **Login.gov** are types of sign-in accounts—not separate tools or websites—by using the phrase “**ID.me** account” or “**Login.gov** account.”
- Added guidance on the term "**DS Logon**":
  > VA no longer offers the ability to sign in with a DS Logon username and password. Use this term only in reference to this option going away or the ability to use this option for Defense Department (DOD) websites.
- Added guidance on using the "MFA" acronym: Introduce "MFA" on the first mention and use "MFA" on any subsequent mentions on the same page.
- Updated the "**My HealtheVet**" guidance:
  > With rare temporary exceptions, VA no longer offers the **My HealtheVet** user ID and password option for sign in. Today, **My HealtheVet on VA.gov** refers instead only to the health portal on VA.gov. When using this term to refer to the portal, “My HealtheVet” is 2 words. Don’t italicize the “e” between “Health” and “Vet” in digital content body copy, headlines, or user interface elements such as links, buttons, and navigation. The “e” is italicized only in the logo and in print materials.<p>
**Note:** We no longer tell Veterans to create new **My HealtheVet** accounts or upgrade existing accounts. We don't use the terms "My HealtheVet basic," "My HealtheVet advanced," or "My HealtheVet Premium." Don't refer to the sign-in account Veterans use to access their health portal as a **My HealtheVet account**. Instead, refer to the type of sign-in account (**ID.me** or **Login.gov**) or simply "your sign-in account."
- Added "My HealtheVet account" to the retired terms and updated the guidance:
  > With rare temporary exceptions, VA no longer offers this sign-in option. Don't refer to the sign-in account Veterans use to access their health portal as a **My HealtheVet account**. Instead, refer to the type of sign-in account (**ID.me** or **Login.gov**) or simply "your sign-in account."

#### [Links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links)

- Updated the **Considerations** section to make guidance clearer:
  >• We use links to connect Veterans and other visitors with related information that may be helpful to them.<br>
  • We put links on their own line to help make the page easier to scan and the intention of the link as clear as possible. Too many embedded links can be distracting or overwhelming to people with traumatic brain injuries or other cognitive impairments.<br>
  • We tell people where links are taking them and why. External links can be disorienting for all people, but especially people who use screen readers. 
- Updated guidance in the **Link text** section to make guidance clearer:
  >• Describe the purpose of the linked page<br>
  • If the link takes the reader outside of VA.gov, name the external website in the link text<br>
  • Balance link text length to provide the needed descriptions without having the relevant words get lost in the length<br>
  • Use "Select" instead of "Click here," since not all people are physically clicking links 
- Added a new section on linking to forms: linking to the form's About page instead of the PDF (applies to all content other than the form's About page), linking directly to the form's PDF on the About page, and added exceptions for links to the direct download to the PDF version:
  >• For forms that aren’t part of the VA forms database, you may need to use a direct download link to the PDF version of the form. This is a rare situation. Contact the centralized content and information architecture (IA) team for guidance.<br>
  • You may also need a direct download link if the person filling out the form is downloading and generating their own completed copy. Contact the centralized content and IA team for guidance.
- Added new guidance in the **Linking to documents and other file sources** section:
  >• If a link opens a calendar, YouTube video, XLS, or other file format, add the relevant icon from the Components section in the Design System. This does not apply to pages housed within Drupal.<br>
  • Include the file format (ex. PDF, HTML, or XML) in the link label. Place the file format at the end of the link label in parentheses. For example, “Download the Continuity of Care document (PDF).”<br>
  • If you have a list of links to the same document with different file formats, consider rewording the link text to include the file format earlier. Contact the centralized content and IA team for help with your link text.
- Added guidance on not linking to the Code of Federal Regulations on VA.gov pages.
- Added a new section on [Links in lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links#links-in-lists) that includes general guidance and 3 options for adding links to lists.
