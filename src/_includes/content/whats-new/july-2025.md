#### [Bulleted and numbered lists](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bulleted-lists)

-	Changed the page title to **Bulleted and numbered lists**.
-	Added a new section on links in lists:<br>
> **Links in lists**<br>
    •	List items can be links in certain situations. But we don't want to overwhelm people with a long list of links, if possible.<br>
    •	Not all items in a list need to be a link. It's okay to have only 1 or 2 items in a list linked.<br>
    •	If every item in a list is a link, keep the list short (less than 7 items). Every link should go to a different location—don't link to the same page multiple times in the list.<br>
    •	When a list item is a link, the entire list item must be part of the link. Don't link just 1 or 2 words.

-	Added guidance around when to use conjunctions:<br>
> **Example of bulleted list with conjunctions**<br>
    For complex eligibility criteria, we use the conjunctions "and" or "or" at the end of each individual requirement in the list to help make the relationship between the requirements clear. In these cases, use a comma before the conjunction and bold the "**and**" or "**or**" at the end of each bullet point. Always separate out lists of "**and**" and "**or**" requirements.

-	We also revised the examples and made edits to the current guidance to fit our style, but these changes don't impact the guidance itself.

#### [Additional info](https://design.va.gov/components/additional-info)

-	Specified that titles should be one sentence with no ending punctuation.
-	Clarified what formatting is okay to use in body copy (lists and links are okay). Removed mentions of using headings in the component (these might be better as accordions).
-	Updated the guidance on the length of the content to fewer than 500 characters (with spaces) when possible. The component won't cut off the content at 500, but we should aim to keep these on the shorter side.
