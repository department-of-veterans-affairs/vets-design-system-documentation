-	List items can be links in certain situations. But we don’t want to overwhelm people with a long list of links, if possible.
-	Not all items in a list need to be a link. It’s okay to have only 1 or 2 items in a list linked.
-	If every item in a list is a link, keep the list short (less than 7 items). Every link should go to a different location—don’t link to the same page multiple times in the list.
-	If 1 link applies to all items in the list, add the link on a separate line after the list.

There are 3 options for adding links to list items. The formatting depends on what fits best with the content. The VA.gov content and IA team can help you pick the best option for your content.

**Option 1**

For lists with only a few items that have relevant links, add the links on a separate line after each list item. Use a soft return (shift + enter on PCs, shift + return on Macs) so the link appears on a separate line, aligned with the list indent, with no space between the lines.

**Option 2**

When you have a list of brief items, make each of the list items a link. With this option, include the entire list item as part of the link. Don’t link just 1 or 2 words.
