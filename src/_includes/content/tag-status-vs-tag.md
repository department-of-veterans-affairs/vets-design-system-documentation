### When to use a Status Tag vs. a Tag

#### Status Tags
[Status Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/tag/tag-status/) show the current status or progress of something, such as "Claim Approved" or "Appointment Pending." They use semantic colors and concise text to quickly communicate urgency or outcome.

- Use for status updates: informational, success, warning, or error.
- Choose when color and text indicate urgency, priority, or required action.

#### Tags
Tags organize or group items by type or category (like "Benefit Type" or "Document Category"). They help sort information but don’t indicate status.

- Use for labeling or categorizing items.
- Choose when color isn’t tied to urgency or meaning.
  
### Special use cases
Internal VA teams building with the Design System have more flexibility in applying color options for Tags and Status Tags than external or VFS teams. However, always ensure color choices meet accessibility requirements. Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios (WCAG 2.2 AA) between the tag background and the page background, and between the text color and the tag background.
