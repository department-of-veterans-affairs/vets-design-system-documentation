* **Select the list type.** Use numbered (also called “ordered”) lists when giving steps that someone must follow in a specific order. Use bulleted (also called “unordered”) lists for any list that doesn’t require a specific order.
* **Introduce the list.** Introduce the list with a full sentence. Avoid using “the following” in the list introduction and use a less formal phrase instead. For example, instead of “You’ll need the following documents,” use “You’ll need these documents.”
* **Don’t combine the list items’ starting word or phrase with the introduction.** For example, don’t introduce the list with “All of these must be true. You’re:” In this case, each item should start with “You’re.” This helps when the content needs to be translated into another language.
* **Avoid single-item lists.** Don't use a numbered or bulleted list for only 1 item.
* **Avoid using sub-bullets.** Sub-bullets can make the content harder to scan. If possible, make the item with sub-bullets a separate list.<br>
  **Note:** Bulleted lists can be used in step-by-step lists.
* **Keep each item in a list succinct.** Aim for no more than 1 or 2 sentences per list item to keep lists easy to scan.  
* **Connect items appropriately.** When using "and" or "or" at the end of each list item, use a comma and bold the "and" or "or" at the end of each item.<br>
  **Note:** Don't use "and/or" in lists. Instead, restructure the content to list all options (for example, "your income and/or net worth" should be "your income, your net worth, or both").
* **Keep each list to no more than 7 items.** If your list has more than 7 items, use subheads to break out the list into smaller, easier-to-digest lists.
* **Use parallel construction within a list.** Each list item should be consistent. For example, starting with a verb or noun phrase.
