* **Introduce the list.** Introduce the list with a full sentence.
* **Capitalize the first word.** Use sentence case and begin lists with a capital letter.
* **No single item lists.** Don't use an ordered or unordered (bulleted) list for only one item.
* **Item content must be succinct.** Keep each item succinct for scannability (for example, 1 or 2 sentences each).  
* **Connect items appropriately.** When using "and" or "or" at the end of each bullet point, use a comma and bold the "and"/"or" at the end of each bullet point. 
* **No more than 7 items without a break.** If your list has more than 7 items, use subheads to break out the list into smaller bullet lists.
* **Use parallel construction within a list.** Each list item should be consistent. For example, starting with a verb or noun phrase.
