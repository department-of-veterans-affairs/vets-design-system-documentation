Don't use periods in PO for PO Box. 

Write out street names (street, road, avenue, boulevard, highway, etc.) in both body copy and in address blocks. Don't abbreviate.

When a street address contains a compass point (north, south, etc.), defer to the way it's referenced locally. For example, some cities may abbreviate compass points like north and south for some but not all streets.
<p>
  In the examples below, we spell out the street names, and style the compass points the way they're locally referenced in Washington, D.C., and New York City, which both abbreviate compass points.

### Zip codes

When we ask a Veteran to fill out their address, we don't require them to include the extra 4 digits of their zip code. But when we (VA) provide an address for Veterans to send documents to, we sometimes include the extra 4 digits of the zip code.
