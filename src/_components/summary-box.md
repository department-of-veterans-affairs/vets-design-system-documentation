## Usage

### Additional guidance for VA

### When to use summary box

* **Highlight the most important information.** The Summary box component is for calling out key details that readers shouldnâ€™t miss. It was originally intended to hold eligibility data exclusively. The content should be "evergreen", not time sensitive.

### When to consider something else

* **Basic overview information.** This component is not intended for basic overview information.
* **Related content.** Don't use this component to highlight related information on, and drive Veterans to, other pages. Use [related or major links]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/link/collection#related-links), [media cards]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/card#media), or stories (depending on template options) instead for this purpose.
* **Table of contents.** Do not use a Summary box component for a table of contents. Use the [On this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/on-this-page) component instead for in-page navigation.
* **Dynamic highlight.** If you're highlighting something that was dynamically added to the page in response to a user action, use a variation of an [Alert]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/alert) component.
* **Time sensitive.** If you have a message that will appear only for a defined period of time, use an [Alert]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/alert) component instead.
* **Sibling content.** Use [accordions]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/accordion) to hold chunks of sibling content. For example, accordions are used in forms on the review screen.
* **Additional context.** To reveal helpful background information in a form use the  [Additional information]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/additional-info) component. Additional info is especially useful when the content is closely tied to a particular message or input on the screen. The lighter design prevents breaking up the visual progression as the user navigates the form. These can also serve as alternative to where accordions feel too heavy.

### Placement

Summary box is found towards the top of the page after the h1 title of the page and [intro text]({{ site.baseurl }}/foundation/typography#paragraphs).

### How to use the Summary box component

* Features must use a `h2`, `h3` or `h4` heading depending on what the appropriate heading level is for your page based on the content of your page.
* Also supports open text, such as `<p>`, `<ul>`, and `<ol>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<a>`.

## Code usage

## Content considerations

* **Keep content brief.** If there are more than 5 bullet points, the bullet points are longer than 20 words, or the bullet points require a header, image or button consider using simple body text, headings, and lists instead.
