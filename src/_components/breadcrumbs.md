### Additional guidance for VA

### When to use

* **Hierarchies more than 2 levels.** Use a breadcrumb when the section of content is more than 2 levels deep.
* **Include one, include all.** If you use a breadcrumb for one page in a hierarchy, use a breadcrumb for all pages within that hierarchy.

### When to consider something else

* **Simple sections of the site.** Do not use a breadcrumb if the section of the site is not every deep (i.e. only 2 levels of content or less)
* **Irrelevant hierarchy.** Do not use a breadcrumb if the path or hierarchy of the page is irrelevant to the user or experience.

### Usability guidance

* **Hierarchical relationships, not linear paths.** Breadcrumbs should be based on content hierarchy, not on the user’s click path or browser history. For online applications and forms, the breadcrumb represents the forms’s placement within the site hierarchy, it does not track the steps or progress of the form flow.
* **Match the text of the title (h1).** Breadcrumb segment text must match the text of the title (h1) text of a corresponding page and not be an abbreviation or variation of that title. When writing H1s for a page, follow the [content styleguide for writing page titles]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles).
Start with "VA.gov home". Clearly indicate that the home page is the VA.gov home page. This clarifies placement within broader VA.gov site, and ensures there's no confusion between the VA.gov home page and the landing page of a section of the site.

#### Breadcrumbs in form flows

* In form flows, the breadcrumb should only show up to the form introduction page as the final segment, and maintain that display while the user progresses through the flow. This allows the user to easily get to the beginning of the form flow. Forward and backward CTAs can be provided within the page to allow page by page navigation. The breadcrumb works in concert with the [Progress bar - Segmented component]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/form/progress-bar-segmented) to provide context for where a user is in a process and on the site.
* When using the [Header - Minimal]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/header/header-minimal), the breadcrumb can be removed to further prevent the user from easily navigating away and not not accomplishing their main task. In this case, the breadcrumb can be replaced with a "Back" link that allows the user to navigate backwards in the flow.

### Placement

* The breadcrumb should be placed below the header and above the main content.
* The placement of the breadcrumb must be consistent from page to page.
* Spacing for the breadcrumb is built in to the component and should be consistent throughout all layouts. The correct spacing is specified in the images below:

{% include component-example.html alt="Breadcrumbs have 20px / 2.5 spacing units above and 32px / 4 spacing units below at a mobile breakpoint." file="/images/components/breadcrumbs/breadcrumbs-spacing-mobile.png" caption="Breadcrumbs have 20px or 2.5 spacing units above and 32px or 4 spacing units below at a mobile breakpoint." %}

{% include component-example.html alt="Breadcrumbs have 20px / 2.5 spacing units above and 48px / 6 spacing units below at a desktop breakpoint." file="/images/components/breadcrumbs/breadcrumbs-spacing-desktop.png" caption="Breadcrumbs have 20px or 2.5 spacing units above and 48px or 6 spacing units below at a desktop breakpoint." %}

### Behavior

* All links in the breadcrumb should be interactive and link to their corresponding page, or in the case of the current page link, link to content on the current page.

### SEO considerations

* Search engines utilize breadcrumbs to understand your site structure and gain additional context about your page to help in ranking.
* Breadcrumbs can also be displayed in search engine results pages (SERPs), which provides additional context to users about your page.
* Breadcrumbs are not the only element used by search engines, go to [writing for SEO in the content styleguide]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/seo) for more SEO assistance.

{% include component-docs.html component_name=page.web-component %}

### Router link support

To use React Router with this component [follow these instructions](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/uswds-va-breadcrumbs--with-router-link-support#with-router-link-support).

## Content considerations

* **Use "VA.gov home" as the default home crumb title.** This component will default to "VA.gov home" for the first crumb. This is the preferred content for this crumb. Deviation from this should only be done with express permission from CAIA.

## Accessibility considerations

<a class="vads-c-action-link--blue" href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/breadcrumb/#accessibility-select">Refer to the U.S. Web Design System for accessibility guidance</a>

### Additional accessibility guidance for VA

* **Make current page a link.** Use a link for the current page for robustness. While it may sound counterintuitive to link to the current page in this component, it makes sense to include this as a link so screen readers voice the current page link whether the user navigates by element or by tabbing. Making the current page a link rather than text makes it a focusable and clickable element. It also follows [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) guidances](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/breadcrumb/examples/breadcrumb/) which states that an `a` element with `aria-current="page"` should represent the current page.
