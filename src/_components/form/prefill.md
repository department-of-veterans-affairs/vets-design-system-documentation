## Examples

### Intro

<div class="site-showcase">
  {% include_relative html/prefill-intro.html %}
</div>

## Usage

### When to use

* **When prefilling information from the user's profile.** These messages communicate to the user that their profile information has been leveraged to pre-populate the form that they are filling out and informs the user that their progress will be saved as they complete the form.

### When to consider something else

* **Unauthenticated users.** Users who are unauthenticated should not see this message as we cannot use their profile data to prefill the form.

### How this component works

* **Uses Alert - Informational.** This component is an instance of the [Alert - Informational]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/alert#informational-alert) component, with specific pre-determined content.

### Placement

* This component appears after the subtitle of the form and before the action link to start the form process on the authenticated variation of the [Form - Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}/templates/forms/introduction#authenticated) page.

## Code usage

Code for both variations of this component is shown in the [examples](#examples).

## Content considerations

Message content for both variations can be found in [engagement messages]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/engagement).
