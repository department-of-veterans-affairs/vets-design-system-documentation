## Usage

### When to use date input

- Use a month, day, year date input component for a date a user knows, like a date of birth or marriage.  (Example: July 21, 1992). Or a date they can easily look up (for example, the expiration date of a credit card).
- Use the [month year](#monthyear) variant for a date a user can approximate, like a date they graduated from high school or a GED equivalent. (Example: May 2010) 

### When to consider something else

Do not use the date input component if users are unlikely to know the exact date of the event youâ€™re asking about. You may consider using a date picker for scheduling, with the following caveats

- We do not currently have a calendar picker as part of the design system. For reference, visit the VA online scheduling tool (VAOS) to see an experimental version of a calendar picker.
- Date pickers have not been tested for accessibility, and may lead to launch blocking issues for your product unless carefully designed with an accessibility specialist. We strongly recommend reaching out to #accessibility-help on slack for support before considering this pattern.

### How to use date inputs

- The component consists of two select boxes for month and day inputs and a text input for year input. For those components please check the usability guidance for select boxes and text inputs
- For the month select box, provide the user unabbreviated months to choose from. Example: January

### Validation
By default all date components have the following validation:
- Cannot have blank values
- Month and Day must be valid numbers
- The Year cannot fall outside of the range of 1900 through the current year plus 100 years

The option to add [custom validation](#with-custom-validation) is available as well.
