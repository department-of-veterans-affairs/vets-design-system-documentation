## Usage

### When to use date inputs
- Use a month, day, year date input component for a date a user knows, like a date of birth or marriage.  (Example: July 21, 1992). 
- Use a month year date input component for a date a user can approximate, like a date they graduated from high school or a GED equivalent. (Example: May 2010) 

### When to consider something else

If users are trying to schedule something, consider using a calendar picker.

**Note:** We do not currently have a calendar picker as part of the design system. For reference, visit the VA online scheduling tool (VAOS) to see an experimental version of a calendar picker. 

### How to use date inputs

- The component consists of two select boxes for month and day inputs and a text input for year input. For those components please check the usability guidance for select boxes and text inputs
- For the month select box, provide the user unabbreviated months to choose from. Example: January

{% include component-docs.html component_name=page.web-component %}

## Accessibility considerations

Follow text input and select box guidance. The component consists of two select boxes for month and day inputs and a text input for year input.
