## Usage

### When to use date input

- Use a month, day, year date input component for a date a user knows, like a date of birth or marriage.  (Example: July 21, 1992). 
- Use the [month year](#monthyear) variant for a date a user can approximate, like a date they graduated from high school or a GED equivalent. (Example: May 2010) 

### When to consider something else

If users are trying to schedule something, consider using a calendar picker.

**Note:** We do not currently have a calendar picker as part of the design system. For reference, visit the VA online scheduling tool (VAOS) to see an experimental version of a calendar picker. 

### How to use date inputs

- The component consists of two select boxes for month and day inputs and a text input for year input. For those components please check the usability guidance for select boxes and text inputs
- For the month select box, provide the user unabbreviated months to choose from. Example: January

### Validation
By default all date components have the following validation:
- Cannot have blank values
- Month and Day must be valid numbers
- The Year cannot fall outside of the range of 1900 through the current year plus 100 years

The option to add [custom validation](#with-custom-validation) is available as well.
