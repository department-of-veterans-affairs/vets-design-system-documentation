## Examples

### Default

<div class="site-showcase">
  {% include_relative html/autosave.html %}
</div>

## Usage

<va-alert status="info" slim>
  <p class="vads-u-margin-y--0">Testing has revealed issues with this component. See this <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/blob/main/Accessibility/save-in-progress.md">Usability Report</a> for more details.</p>
</va-alert>

### When to use

* **When saving form flow progress as a user completes an application.** This message provides confirmation to the user that their form progress is being saved as they progress through a form flow for an application. 

### When to consider something else

* **Unauthenticated users.** Users who are unauthenticated should not see this message as we cannot save their progress.

### How this component works

* **Use Alert - Slim.** This component is an instance of the [Alert - Slim]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/alert#background-color-only-alert-with-icon) component in the success state.

### Placement

* This component appears after the [Button pair]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/button/button-pair) on a form page and before the link to "Finish this application later" on the authenticated variation of the [Form - Step page]({{ site.baseurl }}/templates/forms/#step-form-pages).

## Code usage

Code for this component is shown in the [examples](#examples).

## Content considerations

* Message content can be found in the example above or in [engagement messages]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/engagement).
* This message is to be accompanied by text that reads: "We'll save your application on every change." and appears just below the [Progress bar - Segmented]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/progress-bar-segmented) component on [Form - Step pages]({{ site.baseurl }}/templates/forms/#step-form-pages).

## Accessibility considerations

* Use `aria-describedby` to link a portion of the autosave message to the continue button. To do this add `aria-describedby="save"` to the Continue button and add a `<span id="save">` around the first line of text in this component. This achieves the following:
    * Better ensures screen reader users will not miss the auto save message (which is located below the continue button)
    * Does not change the visual design of the page
    * Is flexible to the level of screen reader use (beginners are more likely to hear the auto-save message whereas advanced users won't be bothered by it)
