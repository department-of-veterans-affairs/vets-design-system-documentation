## Usage

### When to use Component name

* **To collect a signature.**: This component collects a digital signature from the user to certify their submission. This component is used in the [Ask users for a signature]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/ask-users-for/signature) pattern.

### How this component works

The component works by asking the user to populate the text-input field with their name. That name must match the name entered earlier into the form on a previous step. If the name does not match, an error message is returned.

### Behavior

* **When using this pattern, do not add the privacy policy checkbox at the end of the form.** The user does not need to check another checkbox for privacy policy.

### Placement

* **Place the component underneath the accordions on the review page.** Do not hide this component inside an accordion.
