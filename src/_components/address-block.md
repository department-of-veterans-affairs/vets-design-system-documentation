## Examples

{% include storybook-preview.html story="components-address-block--default" %}

## Usage

### When to use address block

* **Addresses in content blocks**: Use an address block to call out an address when it sits within a content block. The blue bar will bring attention to the address block and make it easier to find when scanning a page.
* **Form intro pages**: Use an address block on form introductory pages where the mailing address is needed.

### When to consider something else

* **Clear Address header**: If the Address is directly below a clear header named "Address", as it is on VA Health Center pages, then the address block with blue border is not necessary.
* **Accordions for a series**: If you have a series of addresses in the body of a page and outside of a form or tool then an [Accordion]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/accordion) can be used. For example, if you have 3 or more addresses in succession.  
* **Phone numbers in isolation**: If you need to show one or more phone numbers, use the [Telephone]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/telephone) component.

### Placement

* Address block can appear within a block of content following a paragraph, list, or header.


### Instances of this component in production

{% include component-example.html alt="Example of this component in isolation." file="/images/components/address-block/mailing-address.png" caption="Use of this component for a VA Debt Management Center address." width="50%" %}

{% capture example_like_this %}
  {% include component-example.html alt="Example of this component to show Veteran personal information." file="/images/components/address-block/veteran-personal-info.png" caption="Use of this component for Veteran personal information." %}
{% endcapture %}


{% capture example_not_this %}
  {% include component-example.html alt="Example of this component used incorrectly for phone numbers instead of addresses and by directly overriding styles to remove the blue border." file="/images/components/address-block/do-not-override-styling.png" caption="Use of this component is not for phone numbers in isolation and the blue border should not be removed." %}
{% endcapture %}

{% include _like-this-not-this.html like_this=example_like_this not_this=example_not_this %}

## Code usage

* The Address block component is created by applying the CSS class <code>.va-address-block</code> to a <code><p></code> HTML element.
* Only use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address"><code><address></code></a> HTML element for contact information related to the current page. <code><address></code> is only intended for contact information and not physical addresses (e.g. not for a Health Center facility address).
