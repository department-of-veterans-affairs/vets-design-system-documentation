## Usage

Because tabs stack horizontally or wrap to a second line, they're not an optimal design solution for mobile viewports. In some cases, using 2 tabs (only) to present a set of complementary options is acceptable.

### When to use tabs

* To group 2 to 3 pieces of related content that the user doesn't need to read at the same time.
* To allow the user to easily toggle between a binary set of options, like Search by name/Search by location or View list/View map.

### When to consider something else

* Consider using a single-select [accordion](https://design.va.gov/components/accordions) to display one chunk of content at a time.
* If your content is hierarchical and/or sequential, consider using a single page of well-formatted headings and body text.

### Behavior and design

* Allow the user to click anywhere on a tab to select it.
* Make sure the selected tab is highlighted and visually connected to the content below it.
* Never let a row of tabs wrap to a second line.
* Keep the interaction design simple. Document selected and not selected tab styles along with the focus state for each style. Hover and active states are optional for tabs.

## Content considerations

* Keep tab labels succinct and use plain language. Labels should be 1 to 2 words.
* Use sentence case for tab labels.

## Accessibility considerations

* Go to Mozilla's [ARIA: tab role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tab_role) documentation for guidance.
