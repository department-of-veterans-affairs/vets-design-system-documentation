# Links

A link is a navigation element that can appear alone, inline, or in a group with other links. A link can be used with an icon to trigger a download, such as a PDF, but in general links go places when clicked. 

## Examples

### Standard link

### Download link (with icon)

### Action link

### Link groups

Groups of links can be styled differently depending on their context. 

**Major links**

**Related links**

**Quick links**

## Usage

### When to use Links

Use a link when you want to:

- Navigate to another page or jump to a different section on the current page
- Trigger a download such as a PDF
- Make email addresses, dates, and phone numbers open the relevant app by clicking or tapping them
- When you want to draw attention to an important link, consider using an Action link

### When to consider something else

- Use a button when you want to do something such as make a state change or submit a form

### Behavior

## Accessibility considerations

## Accessibility testing

## Content considerations

Link text should always communicate purpose and target, in that order, so users know before clicking where they will be navigated to. See the Content style guide Links entry for more guidance.
