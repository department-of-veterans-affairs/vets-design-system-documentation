# Links

A link is a navigation element that can appear alone, inline (embedded), or in a group with other links. A link can be used to trigger a download, such as a PDF, but in general links go places when clicked.

## Examples

### Embedded links and CTA links

Embedded links are surrounded by text, and should be underlined by default in order to help them stand out. Standalone CTA links call attention to an important link on the page and should start with an action verb. See [Links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links) in the Content style guide for detailed guidance on when to use Embedded links vs. CTA links. 

### Link with icon

### Download link

Download link text must include the name of the file to be downloaded in parentheses. A download link may be accompanied by an icon for emphasis. 

### Action links

Use an Action link to emphasize an important CTA, such as starting an application for benefits. See [Action links](https://design.va.gov/experimental-design/action_links) for more information.

### Link groups

Groups of links are styled differently depending on their context.

## Usage

### When to use Links

Use a link when you want to:

- Navigate to another page or jump to a different section on the current page
- Trigger a download such as a PDF
- Make email addresses, dates, and phone numbers open the relevant app by clicking or tapping them
- When you want to draw attention to an important link, consider using an Action link

### When to consider something else

- Use a button when you want to do something such as make a state change or submit a form

### Behavior

A link has four states: default, hover, active, and visited.

## Accessibility considerations

Link text importance. Focus behavior. 

## Accessibility testing

## Content considerations

Link text should always clearly communicate purpose and target so users know before clicking where they will be navigated to. See [Links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links) in the Content style guide for more information.
