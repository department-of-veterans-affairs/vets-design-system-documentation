# Links

<div class="va-introtext" markdown="1">
A link is a navigation element that can appear alone, inline (embedded), or in a group with other links. A link can be used to trigger a download, such as a PDF, but in general links go places (on the same page or another page) when clicked.

## Examples

### Embedded links vs. CTA links

Embedded links are surrounded by text, and should be underlined in their default state to help them stand out. Standalone CTA links call attention to an important link on the page, and usually begin with an action verb (such as "Download"). See [Links in the Content style guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links) for more information on when to use Embedded links vs. CTA links.

## Usage

### When to use Links

Use a link when you want to:

- Navigate to another page or jump to a different section on the current page.
- Trigger a download such as a PDF.
- Make email addresses, dates, and phone numbers open the relevant app by clicking or tapping them.

### When to consider something else

- Use a button when you want to make a state change or submit a form. Buttons **do something**, whereas links **go places**.
- When you want to draw attention to an important CTA on the page, such as a link that launches a benefit application, use an Action link.

### Behavior

A link has four main states: default, hover, active, and visited.

## Accessibility considerations

- In order to achieve material honesty, a link should not be styled to look or behave like a button.

## Content considerations

- Link text should clearly communicate purpose and target (in that order), so users know where they'll be navigated upon clicking.
- Clearly label external links that go to other federal agences.
- For non-federal external links, explicitly state that the content is not endorsed by the federal government.   

## Link patterns

### Link groups

Groups of links can be styled differently depending on their context. 

**Major links**

**Related links**

**Quick links**
