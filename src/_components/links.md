# Links

A link is a navigation element that can appear alone, inline, or in a group with other links. A link can be used to trigger a download, such as a PDF, but in general links go places when clicked. 

## Examples

### Standard link

### Download link

A download link may be accompanied by an icon for emphasis. Download link text must include the name of the file to be downloaded in parentheses. 

### Action link

### Link groups

Groups of links are styled differently depending on their context. 

**On this page jump links**

## Usage

### When to use Links

Use a link when you want to:

- Navigate to another page or jump to a different section on the current page
- Trigger a download such as a PDF
- Make email addresses, dates, and phone numbers open the relevant app by clicking or tapping them
- When you want to draw attention to an important link, consider using an Action link

### When to consider something else

- Use a button when you want to do something such as make a state change or submit a form

### Behavior

A link has four states: default, hover, active, and visited.

## Content considerations

Link text should always clearly communicate purpose and target so users know before clicking where they will be navigated to. See the Content style guide Links entry for more guidance.
