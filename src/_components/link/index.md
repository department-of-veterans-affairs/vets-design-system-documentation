{% include _site-in-this-section.html %}

## Examples

### Default
{% include storybook-preview.html story="components-va-link--default" link_text="va-link" %}

### Active

{% include storybook-preview.html story="components-va-link--active" link_text="active va-link" %}

- For links that have less hierarchy than an Action Link, we recommend using an Active Link. Active Links can be accompanied by a right-facing chevron icon for more emphasis. 
- Active links can be seen on [Hub pages]({{ site.baseurl }}/templates/hub#example)
- Active link text is bold.

### Download

{% include storybook-preview.html story="components-va-link--download" link_text="download va-link" %}

- Use for download links including but not limited to PDFs and Excel files. The download icon is optional but encouraged.
- When using for a PDF, use only for linking directly to a PDF, not as a trigger for a process that generates a PDF. For [generating a PDF, use a button](#links-vs-buttons).

### Video

{% include storybook-preview.html story="components-va-link--video" link_text="video va-link" %}

- Use when linking directly to a YouTube video.

### Channel

{% include storybook-preview.html story="components-va-link--channel" link_text="channel va-link" %}

- Use when linking to a YouTube channel.

## Usage

### When to use Links

Use a link when you want to:

- Navigate to another page (internal or external)
- Anchor, or jump, to a specific header and section on a page
- Trigger a download such as a PDF
- Play a video
- Make email addresses and phone numbers open the relevant app by clicking or tapping them

### When to consider something else

- **Use buttons for actions.** Use a [Button]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/button) when you want to make a state change or submit a form. Example actions include, but are not limited to, "Add", "Close", "Cancel", or "Save". Buttons **do things**, links **go places**. Refer to guidance on [Links vs. buttons]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/link/action#links-vs-buttons)
- **Use action links for calls-to-action.** When you want to draw attention to an important call-to-action (CTA) on the page, such as a link that launches a benefit application, use an [Action link]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/link/action). Calls-to-action are not actions themselves (see the previous point). 
- **Table of contents.** When you want to make a long page of content with two or more H2s easier to navigate, use an [On this page link]({{ site.baseurl }} /components/on-this-page).

### How to use Links

- **Open in the same window except in certain instances.** Links should only open in a new tab if clicking the link will result in the user losing progress or data. Otherwise, links should open in the same window.
- **Use semantically appropriate encodings.** Encode email and phone links with `mailto:` and `tel:`, respectively.
- All links use Source Sans Pro (Regular), underlined, at 16px.
- All links share the same color (`$color-link-default` `#004795`) for icon, link text, and underline. 
- All text links should be underlined. This is especially important for low-vision users. (Exception: [side navigation links]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/sidenav) should not be underlined.)

## Content considerations

{% include content/links.md %}

## Accessibility considerations

- **Material honesty**: Do not style a link to look or behave like a button ([material honesty](https://alistapart.com/article/material-honesty-on-the-web/)).
- **Keyboard navigation**: The user must be able to navigate to links using the Tab key and activate links using the Enter key.
- **Purpose and target**: Without a purpose and target, everyone-- but especially screen reader users-- will struggle to understand where they may be routed off to.
