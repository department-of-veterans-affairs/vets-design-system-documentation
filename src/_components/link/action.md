## Usage

### When to use an Action Link

The action link is an eye-catching link to start a digital service. An action link entices users to take action. Example: Starting a benefit application.

* **Primary entry is for entry points to an application.** The Link - Action - Primary entry variation was added to stand out within text-heavy pages and to be distinct from a button, yet have a similar visual weight to a button for emphasis. Use the Primary entry variation to start an application. Current examples include the Form Upload tool and form-based applications. This variation replaces the Link - Action - Primary (green) variation which had been used for this purpose. Use only one Link - Action - Primary entry per page.
* **Primary calls to action.** A Link - Action - Primary (green) can be used for the primary call to action on a page. A Primary entry variation is preferred, but the Primary variation is allowed. Use only one Link - Action - Primary per page.
* **Use the secondary variation for additional important links.** Use the Link - Action - Secondary (blue) variation when there are multiple Action Links on a page or if the actions are of equal hierarchy.
* **Use the Link - Action - Reverse (white) variation for a dark background.** The reverse variation exists to meet contrast on dark backgrounds. This variation is used sparingly.
* **Primary and secondary can go on the same page.** Link - Action - Primary (green) and Link - Action - Secondary (blue) instances can exist on the same page, but we don’t recommend placing them side by side.

### When to consider something else

* **Use buttons for authentication action.s** Don’t use Link - Action for these actions: “sign up,” “submit” or “sign out.” For these actions, use [buttons]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/button) instead.
* **Use a button for going to the next step in a form.** Use Button - Primary for moving between steps of an online application or tool. This is considered an action rather than navigation. Note that we prefer a [Back link]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/link/#back) for navigation backward in a flow but have instances of using a Button - Secondary in most forms.
* **Don’t use Link - Action for non-actions.** Link - Action is not meant to replace all links. It should be used explicitly for actions.

## Content considerations

* **Keep Link - Action content short.** Start with a verb. For example: “*Apply for health care benefits*” or “*Register for care*”
* Refer to the [Content Style Guide on Links]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/links).

## Accessibility considerations

* **Purpose and target.** Link text that doesn't indicate a clear purpose or destination makes it harder for everyone--especially screen reader users--to understand where they're getting routed off to.
* **External links must indicate that they are external.** Follow the methods detailed in [linking to external sites]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/links#linking-to-external-sites).
  * By default, the link component's external link variation will append the text, "(opens in a new tab)", instead of using an icon. This follows [Techniques for WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G201.html) advice on providing users with both a spoken and visual warning that this link opens in a new tab.
