# Process lists

<div class="va-introtext" markdown="1">
The process list, also known as the subway map, is used in a static informational context to describe the process to apply for a benefit or to provide tracking information to a user where they are in a given process.
</div>

<div class="site-showcase">
{% include_relative html/process-steps.html %}
</div>

{% include snippet.html content='html/process-steps.html' %}

## Usability

### Guidance

- Can be used to display up to 20 steps
- List headings should start with a verb.
- Make headings clear and concise. You can always write more content in paragraphs and other HTML elements below the heading.

### When to use

- When users need to see a list of sequential steps
- In a multi-step process where the user may need to track progress over an extended period

### When to consider something else

- The list is a checklist
- The information is not sequential
