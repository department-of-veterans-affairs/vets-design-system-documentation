## Usage

### Additional guidance for VA

#### When to use a button

* **Actions.** Use buttons for clickable actions you want users to take on a page, such as “Add”, “Close”, “Cancel”, or “Save.” Buttons **do things**, links **go places**. Refer to guidance on [Links vs. buttons](#links-vs-buttons).
* **Triggers.** Buttons can also trigger functionality via Javascript. For example, closing a modal window. 

#### When to consider something else

* **Non-actions.** For navigation between pages of a website, default to using links. Buttons can be used for navigation between pages within a form flow but otherwise use links. Read the guidance on [links vs. buttons](#links-vs-buttons).
* **Call-to-action.** For a visually prominent call to action that links to another page, use an [Action link]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/action-link).

#### Behavior

* **Avoid using many primary buttons on a single page or section.** Pages with many primary buttons reduces their impact and make it harder for users to know what to do next.
* **Arrows are reserved.** Arrow icons should only appear for "Back" and "Continue" buttons that appear in forms.
* **Use icons only when necessary.** [Icons]({{ site.baseurl }}/foundation/icons) can be used in buttons when additional clarity is required and the icon is highly relevant to the action. Icons should not be used for decoration. Note that va-button does not support iconography, but has some variations that use an icon. Use of icons in buttons will be made on a case-by-case basis. If you feel you need an icon for a button, [follow the process for requesting a new icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/foundation/icons#requesting-a-new-icon) .
* **Avoid disabling buttons.** [Disabling buttons is strongly discouraged.](#do-not-disable-buttons)

### Choosing between variations

* **Use primary for the most important action.** Use the primary button for the most important action that you want the user to take on the page, or in a section.
* **Use secondary for non-primary actions.** Use secondary buttons for any actions that need to be _downplayed_ against other actions on the page, or in a section.

### Placement

* Buttons generally appear on their own line at the bottom of a form or section.
* Primary buttons usually appear first, or to the left, of a secondary button.

### Instances of this component in production

#### Primary button with a secondary link

* **Links can substitute for secondary buttons.** It is not always necessary to pair a secondary button with a primary button. In the example below a link can also suffice for a non-primary action.

{% include component-example.html alt="Example of a primary button with a secondary link." file="/images/components/button/primary-with-secondary-link.png" caption="An example of a primary button used with a secondary link." reverse=true %}


#### Secondary button as radio button

This variation substitutes the large tap target of a button where a radio button would traditionally be used. This serves a similar purpose to the [USWDS Tile variation of a Radio button](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/radio-buttons/). 

* **Limit to Yes/No.** This variation should be limited to Yes/No questions rather than used as a substitute for radio buttons which can more readily handle 3 or more responses.
* **Reflect selections.** The response of the user must change the button from a secondary button to a ```$vads-color-primary-dark``` background in order to reflect the state of the user's response.

## Content considerations

## Accessibility considerations

<a class="vads-c-action-link--blue" href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/button/#accessibility-select">Refer to the U.S. Web Design System for accessibility guidance</a>

### Additional guidance for VA

* **Button labels should never change dynamically or be used to communicate a status.**
* **Mind target size.** We follow the [WCAG 2.2 Target Size - Level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#target-size) criteria which states:
> "The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels..."

That guidance agrees with [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/menus-and-actions/buttons) which recommend that:
> "On a touchscreen, buttons need a hit target of at least 44x44 points to accommodate a fingertip. On all screens, it’s essential to include enough space around a button so that people can visually distinguish it from surrounding components and content, whether people use touch, a pointer, or a system that expands a button when it’s in focus."

* **Use at least [1 spacing unit]({{ site.baseurl }}/foundation/spacing-units) separating tappable elements.**

* **Prioritize a clear and concise button label and only use `message-aria-describedby` when it enhances understanding and accessibility.** The `message-aria-describedby` property emulates HTML's `aria-describedby` due to web component limitations. It allows adding an additional description that is visually hidden, but screen reader accessible.
  * When to use:
    * **Providing additional context or instructions.** If the button label is concise but requires further explanation.
  * When _not_ to use:
    * **Duplicating information.** If the button's label is clear and concise, adding additional information may be redundant and cumbersome for users of assistive technology.
    * **Providing essential information.** Crucial information for the button's purpose should be the button label itself, _not_ solely relying on an additional description.
