# Type-ahed

<p class="va-introtext">Cards group short, related pieces of personalized information into a series of discrete containers, similar to physical index or playing cards. The goal of a card is to present a snapshot of information in one digestable chunk with the option to navigate to more detailed content. The user should be able to easily scan a sequence of cards and take action on the most relevant items.</p>
