# Experimental pattern name 

Briefly describe your proposed Experimental design component/pattern.

## Purpose

Talk about the "why" of your Experimental component/pattern. What problem(s) will you be solving? How will this component/pattern improve the experience of veterans using va.gov and/or be an affordance for designers and developers working on the platform?

## Example

<!-- Insert an image with callouts here, if you have one. Callouts should live as numbered text beneath the image (for accessibility reasons). If the image is large, callout text can live within the image itself as well as beneath it. Use the Anatomy callouts Sketch library in your mockups. -->
