# Appointment Summary Card [DRAFT]

## Who is suggesting it

VA Online Scheduling (VAOS)

## Purpose - Why you needed to create a new component or pattern

VAOS shows Veterans a calendar list of their upcoming appointments, as well as:
* Requested appointments
* Past appointments
* Canceled appointments

In 2020 the VAOS team redesigned our appointment list, after feedback that it was difficult find individual appointments.

The goals of the new design were to make the list:
* Make the list easy to scan by showing consistent appointment details
* Provide clear information about the state of the appointment (upcoming, canceled, etc.)
* Make scanning and opening an appointment easy to use on mobile devices.

## Description of component or pattern

A card that displays a summary of an appointment. When clicked, it opens a new page that provides detailed information abou the appointment.

## Code location, if available
[TBD]
