# Design

<div class="va-introtext" markdown="1">
The design section provides information about the visual language and style used on VA.gov.
</div>

Behind every aspect of the language used on VA.gov lies an intention: to convey interactivity, provide structure to content, and to convey a sense of space and context.

## A consistent experience

In order to maintain a cohesive user experience across the VA.gov platform, it is imperative that design choices are applied thoughtfully and consistently as Veterans navigate across products and services.

## Accessibility

While this guide will always provide accessible samples and usage guidelines, it is still possible to create inaccessible designs using the components and utilities available in Formation. Always remember that the audience using VA.gov may not be visual users,may experience color blindness or have difficulty handling low contrast ratios. Never use color alone as an affordance.
