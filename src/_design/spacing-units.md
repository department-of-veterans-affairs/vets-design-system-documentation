# Spacing units

<div class="va-introtext">
  Formation’s spacing units are based on multiples of 8 to maintain a consistent rhythm when applied to margins, padding, and other dimensions.
</div>

{% include _site-on-this-page.html %}

## Why multiples of 8?

The number 8 is easily broken down into smaller measurements before it approaches sub-pixel units. Additionally, many popular screen sizes are also divisible by 8.

## Using the spacing tokens

In order to keep spacing consistent throughout VA.gov, it is recommended you favor using the `units` functions instead of hard coding pixels (or relative units) for margins and padding.

In order to access the spacing tokens in your project, you will need to import Formation’s [base files](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veteran-facing-services-tools/tree/master/packages/formation/sass/base) into your project files. [Here is how this site is doing that](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/blob/master/src/assets/stylesheets/application.scss#L5).

There are two ways of using the spacing tokens in your code.

### Output CSS as REM units

```css
.foo {
  margin: units(5);
  padding: units(2.5);  
}
```

will compile to:
```css
.foo {
  margin: 4rem;
  padding: 2rem;
}
```

### Output CSS as PX units

```css
.foo {
  margin: units-px(5);
  padding: units-px(2.5);  
}
```

will compile to:
```css
.foo {
  margin: 40px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
