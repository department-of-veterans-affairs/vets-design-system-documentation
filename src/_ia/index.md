## IA Principles

VA.gov and the VA Mobile App follow established IA principles to create intuitive user experiences. These principles guide content organization and navigation design across all VA digital products.

### 1. User-centered design

- Conduct user research to understand how people categorize and search for information.

### 2. Sense of place

- Always provide a sense of place by utilizing design components and content to ensure visitors know where they are within the experience and where they can go next.

### 3. Consistency

- Use a consistent organizational structure and labels across different touchpoints - digital and physical.

### 4. Prioritization

- Limit and prioritize information to ensure its easy to find at time of need, reduce cognitive load, and allow visitors to explore more detailed information at their own pace.

### 5. Findability

- Present information in the right place and in the right way to meet the mental models and needs of visitors.
- Offer multiple ways for visitors to find and access information in order to meet various mental models and help them easily find the information they need.

### 6. Focused navigation

- Use clear navigation menus and labeling to ensure visitors understand the types of information it leads to.
- Provide clear CTAs and focused pathways to and through information to reduce cognitive load, friction, and burden.

### 7. Scalability

- Design a flexible IA and organizational system that allows content and information to grow and evolve over time

## When to think about IA

Thinking about IA is important throughout the planning and design process.  These are some of the more critical events that should trigger a conversation about the IA of your information.

- Launching a new feature or content on VA.gov or within the VA Health and Benefits app
- Adding a new category or subsection to the VA Health and Benefits app
- Adding a new subdomain or subdirectory to VA.gov
- Rewriting or redesigning a feature or content and needing to split or merge pages or screens
- Improving the findability of an existing feature, content, or screen
- Removing a feature, content page, and/or screen
- Changing the UX of global navigational elements or on page/screen buttons or actions
