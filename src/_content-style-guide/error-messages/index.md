intro-text: Error and alert messages tell the person that something went wrong. These messages should be clear, direct, and have a call to action (CTA) that tells the person what to do next to resolve the issue.

Error and alert messages mainly appear in interactive experiences such as tools, forms, and applications. This category of messaging has visual design and formatting that affects content, which we explain in the Help users to recover from errors pattern. 

<va-link-action
  href="{{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/help-users-to/recover-from-errors"
  text="Review the Help users to recover from errors pattern"
  type="secondary"
></va-link-action>

## Error and alert message titles

When possible, keep error and alert message titles (headings) to 50 characters, including spaces. Error and alert message titles should follow the general guidelines for page and section titles.

## Error and alert messages dictionary

The error and alert messages dictionary shows the title, content, component, and state for many common error and alert messages on the site. The messages dictionary is broken up into 4 types of messages:

### [System]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/system)

System messages alert the person of important system-related issues or statuses. System messages are initiated by the system and not by the person’s actions.

### [Engagement]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/engagement)

Engagement messages recommend that the person enter or update data in the system. Engagement messages can be initiated by either the system or another person.

### [Access]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/access)

Access messages appear when the person tries to access an item that’s not available to them. For example, an access message may appear when a record has been deleted or the person doesn’t have access to a piece of information.

### [Feedback]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/feedback)

Feedback messages appear as a response to a person’s actions. The majority of create, read, update, and delete actions will result in feedback messaging.
