<a class="vads-c-action-link--blue" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/help-users-to/recover-from-errors">Review the help users to recover from errors pattern</a>

## Messages dictionary

The messages dictionary holds the title, content, component, and state for each scenario of message on the site. The messages dictionary is broken up into 4 types of messages:

### [System]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/system)

Alerts the user of important system-related issues or status. It’s initiated by the system and it’s not a result of the user’s actions.

### [Engagement]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/engagement)
Nudges the user to enter or update data in the system. It can be initiated by either the system or another user.

### [Access]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/access)
Appears when the user tries to access an item that’s not available to them. It may be because the record has been deleted, the user doesn’t have access, etc.

### [Feedback]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/error-messages/feedback)
The application's response when the user is interacting with it. The majority of create, read, update, delete (CRUD) actions will result in feedback messaging.
