title: Destigmatizing language in substance use
intro-text: "When writing about substance use and substance use disorder, the words we use matter. This is true both in content for Veterans as well as in our treatment plans, policies, and other documents."
---

Research shows that stigmatizing language can make it harder for people with substance use disorder to seek treatment. It can also negatively shape the perspectives of the people providing treatment in a way that negatively impacts the care they provide.

At VA, we use language that reflects how we provide treatment and support to Veterans with substance use disorders:

- We recognize people as human beings first and not as defined by their problems or conditions.
- We know that people have problems but are not themselves the problem.
- We show support and understanding for people who have substance use problems, rather than negativity, punishing attitudes, or blame.
- We recognize substance use disorder as a serious condition and not a choice or “habit.”
