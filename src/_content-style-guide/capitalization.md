# Capitalization

As part of our plain language style, we use sentence capitalization as the standard on VA.gov, with a few exceptions.

## Use sentence case capitalization

Use sentence case capitalization for most content, including page titles, headings, subheadings, buttons, text links, and mobile app interface buttons, unless a word is a proper noun. Don't capitalize common words for emphasis or importance.

### Exceptions where we use title capitalization

- Proper nouns (example: branded terms like "VA.gov," official program names, state names, names of federal agencies, days of the week and months, compositions such as titles of books, etc.)
- The word “Veterans”
- Global navigation, top menu labels (VA Benefits and Health Care; About VA; Find a VA Location)
- For mobile app native actions, use title case for iOS and all caps for Android

### Exceptions where we use initial capitalization
- SEO title tags (example: VA Prescription Refill And Tracking \| Veterans Affairs). See [Writing for SEO]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/seo) for more information.

[Consult our word list]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/word-list) or refer to AP Style if you're not sure whether a term should be capitalized. If still unsure, err on the side of sentence case capitalization.
