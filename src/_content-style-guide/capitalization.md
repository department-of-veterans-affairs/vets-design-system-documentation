# Capitalization

## Use sentence case capitalization

We use sentence case capitalization for most content, including page titles, headings, subheadings, buttons, and text links, unless a word is a proper noun. Don't capitalize common words for emphasis or importance.

### Exceptions where we use title capitalization

- Proper nouns (example: branded terms like "VA.gov," official program names, state names, names of federal agencies, days of the week and months, compositions such as titles of books, etc.)
- The word “Veterans”
- Global navigation, top menu labels (VA Benefits and Health Care; About VA; Find a VA Location)

### Exceptions where we use initial capitalization
- SEO title tags (example: VA Prescription Refill And Tracking \| Veterans Affairs). See [Writing for SEO](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/seo) for more information.

[Consult our word list](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/word-list) or refer to AP Style if you're not sure whether a term should be capitalized. If still unsure, err on the side of sentence case capitalization.
