intro-text: Dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses often appear together, so we've put guidelines for these in one place.

## Dates and years

- Spell out dates in body copy, using the full construction: March 31, 1989. Or January 2, 1980.
- Write out date ranges using sentence construction in body copy: This will be available from  December 1, 2025,  to December 31, 2025.

**Note:** Be intentional when picking “from/to,” “from/through,” or “between/and” for date ranges. Each option can mean different things, so pick the option that best matches your needs.

- Add a comma after the year when using the full construction, unless the date is the end of the sentence. If the date is at the end of the sentence, use the punctuation you’d normally use (period, question mark, colon, no punctuation).
- In general, also spell out days of the week and months in body copy.

### Exceptions

- Use 9/11 when it's part of a program name such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
- Abbreviate days and months when space is very limited, such as in callout boxes, alerts, or promo components, etc.
  - Mon., Tue., Wed., Thu., Fri., Sat., Sun.
  - Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec. (Don't abbreviate March, April, May, June, July.)
  - In application form fields, we often use the construction: mm/dd/yyyy
- Where space is limited, indicate date ranges with the - hyphen without spaces on either side. Don’t combine the hyphen with from/between sentence construction.  

### Years

When referencing decades or periods of years, don't use an apostrophe with the "s."

- **Like this:** The early 2000s
- **Not this:** The early 2000's

## Times and time zones

Write out times, using a.m. and p.m. with periods: 9:00 a.m.

- Spell out noon and midnight. Don't use 12:00 p.m. or 12:00 a.m.
- Include the minutes, even when on the hour.
- When referencing office hours, always use the time zone ET, even if the office is in another location (no parentheses, periods, or daylight/standard).
- When referencing international time zones, use the time zone name for that country or the UTC (coordinated universal time) offset. (Example: Central European Time; Korea Standard Time; UTC +2)
- In an application or tool that has a time stamp of a user's progress or saved work, show hours in their local time zone.
- In body copy, write out ranges using sentence construction: We're open Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET.
- Where space is limited, indicate ranges with the - hyphen without spaces on either side. Don't combine the hyphen with from/between sentence construction.

**Note:** For the mobile app, when times and time zones aren’t hardcoded, the formatting differs from VA.gov due to default formatting in React Native. For example, React Native formats time as AM and PM (both letters capitalized and no punctuation) and EST (3-letter format). We make an exception to our style guide for this default formatting.

## Phone numbers

## Fax numbers

Don’t hyperlink or add aria labels to fax numbers. Make it clear in the surrounding text when a number is a fax number to avoid people mistaking it as a phone number.

**Like this:** If you’re in the U.S., fax your application to 1-844-531-7818.

## Addresses
