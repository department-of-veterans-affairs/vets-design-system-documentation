# Dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses

Dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses often appear together, so we've put guidelines for these in one place.

{% include _site-on-this-page.html %}

## Dates and years

Spell out dates in body copy, using the full construction: March 31, 1989. Or January 2, 1980. In general, spell out days of the week and months also in body copy.

### Exceptions

- Use 9/11 when it's part of a program name such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
- Abbreviate days and months when space is very limited, such as in callout boxes, alerts, or promo components, etc.
  - Mon., Tue., Wed., Thu., Fri., Sat., Sun.
  - Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec. (Don't abbreviate March, April, May, June, July.)
  - In application form fields, we often use the construction: mm/dd/yyyy
    <br>

### Years

When referencing decades or periods of years, don't use an apostrophe with the "s."

- **Like this:** The early 2000s
- **Not this:** The early 2000's

## Times and time zones

Write out times, using a.m. and p.m. with periods: 9:00 a.m.

- Spell out noon and midnight. Don't use 12:00 p.m. or 12:00 a.m.
- Include the minutes, even when on the hour.
- When referencing office hours, always use the time zone ET, even if the office is in another location (no parentheses, periods, or daylight/standard).

- When referencing international time zones, use the time zone name for that country or the UTC (coordinated universal time) offset. (Example: Central European Time; Korea Standard Time; UTC +2)
- In an application or tool that has a time stamp of a user's progress or saved work, show hours in their local time zone.
- In body copy, write out ranges using sentence construction: We're open 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday.
- Where space is limited, indicate ranges with the - hyphen without spaces on either side. Don't combine the hyphen with from/between sentence construction.

## Phone numbers

{% include content/phone-numbers.md %}

## Fax numbers

Don’t hyperlink or add aria labels to fax numbers. Make it clear in the surrounding text when a number is a fax number to avoid people mistaking it as a phone number.

**Like this:** If you’re in the U.S., fax your application to 1-844-531-7818.

## Addresses
