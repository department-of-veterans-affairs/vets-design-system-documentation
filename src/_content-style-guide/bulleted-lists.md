intro-text: Bulleted lists help make information more scannable and easier to understand.  If a sentence contains more than 3 items or ideas, we recommend breaking them up into a bulleted list. These guidelines also apply to content for checkboxes and radio buttons in forms.

## Considerations

{% include content/unordered-list.md %}

## Punctuation

* When the list is made up of fragments or single sentences, don't use ending periods
* If one or more bullets contains an additional sentence, use ending periods on all items in the bulleted list—including any fragments
* Don't use a period at the end of the last bullet in a series of fragments

**Note:** Punctuation of bullets is determined by list, not by page. It's OK to have a list of bullets that are fragments (that don’t use periods) on the same page as a list of bullets with multiple full sentences (that use periods). Just use the correct house style of punctuation for each type of list.

### Example of bulleted list with fragments

Use parallel construction and don't use ending periods for fragments.

### Example of bulleted list with conjunctions

When using "and" or "or" at the end of each bullet point, use a comma and bold the "and"/"or" at the end of each bullet point.

<div class="do-dont__do">

<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">

### Example of bulleted list with more than one sentence

Use ending periods for each bulleted item in a list if any of the items contain a fragment and an additional sentence.

<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
