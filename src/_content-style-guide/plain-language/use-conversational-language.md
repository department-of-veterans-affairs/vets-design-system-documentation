Here's what this means:

- Address Veterans, service members, family members, and other audiences using second person singular: “you” and “your”
- Refer to VA using first person plural: “we,” "us," and “our”  
- For Q&As on VA.gov informational pages (ex. a Q&A on a benefit eligibility page), frame the question as though asked by the Veteran or beneficiary (using “I”) and the answer as though answered by VA (using “we” and “you”)
- In VA forms and interactive tools, frame questions as VA asking the Veteran or beneficiary the question directly (using “we” and “you”)
