title: Structure your content
intro-text: "Structure your content so it's easy to follow. Instead of long paragraphs, chunk content using hierarchical headings (H2s and H3s), bulleted lists, process lists (subway map), and groups of accordion links."

Here are some examples.

## Headers

{% include component-example.html alt="An example of using headers." file="/images/content-style-guide/plain-language/structure-your-content-headers.png" caption="Headers provide the necessary structure to the content of the page. The page title is H1, the first sub-heading is H2, and sub-headings within that section are H3." width="60%" %}

## Accordions

{% include component-example.html alt="An example of using accordions." file="/images/content-style-guide/plain-language/structure-your-content-accordions.png" caption="Accordion groupings condense and group content, providing a scannable overview." width="60%" %}

## Bulleted lists

{% include component-example.html alt="An example of using bulleted lists." file="/images/content-style-guide/plain-language/structure-your-content-lists.png" caption="Bulleted lists help make information more scannable and easier to understand. If a sentence contains more than three items or ideas, we recommend breaking them up into a bulleted list." width="60%" %}
