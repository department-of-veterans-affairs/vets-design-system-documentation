# VA.gov content style guide

<div class="va-introtext" markdown="1">
  This is our house style guide for the VA.gov website. It's shared across VA administrations and teams, so we can speak with one voice and create a consistent, helpful experience for Veterans and non-Veteran customers. This style guide is a living document and will change over time, based on user research and feedback.
</div>

See our [content principles]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/content-principles) for the house voice and tone, and the foundation for how we practice language for and with Veterans in mind.

## What you'll find in this style guide

We've organized the style guide into searchable topics, so you can go directly to the section you need guidance on. This guide covers common issues on VA.gov. It does not cover basic writing mechanics and grammar. (We assume you know those already.)

We follow plain language and web best practices. Where we vary from standard practices, we call them out in the [word list]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/word-list) or as a topic section.

**For issues not covered in this style guide, refer to:**

- AP Style
- [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)
- VA Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs style guide
