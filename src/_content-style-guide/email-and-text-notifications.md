## General guidance for email and text notifications

**Note:** This notifications guidance applies to emails and texts we send to Veterans related to interactions they have with VA—like reminders or updates related to their submitted online forms, disability claims, and health appointments. We're adding more guidance for notifications soon. This guidance may not always apply to outreach emails and texts that we send for awareness and education about VA benefits and services. 

### Follow our content style guide and existing patterns
* Email and text notifications should use plain language and follow our VA style guide wherever possible. This includes addressing the recipient as “you” and using “we” to refer to VA. [Review our top 10 plain language standards](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/plain-language/#top-10-va-plain-language-standards)
* For some types of emails, VA Notify has sample templates with plain language content that's ready to use. You'll just need to fill in any manual variables and adjust other content as needed. This includes the emails in the form submission status pattern. [Review the form submission status pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/help-users-to/stay-informed-of-their-application-status) 

### Protect Veterans' personal information
* Always get approval of new or updated notifications from a VA privacy officer. 
[Find your product's privacy officer (link only works on VA network)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/pull/3406/files#diff-989f423e8013e63dd7c10f19aa0b5c8138e5eb14d00a05b7acba8453d80a457a)
* Email and text notifications are not secure, so we can’t include Veterans’ personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI).
* Privacy officers may allow exceptions to the PII/PHI rule when a Veteran opts in to receive PII/PHI in their notifications. But you must work closely with the privacy office and get specific approval for any notifications that include PII/PHI.

## Email notifications

### Subject line 

* Aim for no more than 9 words and 60 characters in subject lines
* If the goal of the email is to prompt the Veteran to take an action, make the subject line a CTA starting with an action verb
    * Like this: Review your dependent information for VA benefits
* If it's a reminder or confirmation email, make the subject line a short phrase or statement
    * Like this: VA appointment reminder 
    * Like this: We've received your VA form 
* If it's a post-submission failure notification (part of the zero silent failures initiative), start the subject line with "Action needed"
    * Like this: Action needed: We couldn't process your VA form

### Salutation and closing

* Personalize the email with the Veteran's first name in the salutation as “Dear ((first_name)),"—but never include both first and last name, because this counts as PII
* Don't include a closing or sign the email as "VA.gov" or "VA"

**Note:** Don't say "Thank you for your service" in the closing or anywhere else in the email. Research has found that some Veterans may have negative feelings about this phrase.

### Header levels 

* To make your email content accessible and easier to scan, use headers to chunk the content—VA Notify supports header levels 1, 2, and 3
* H1 should be either exactly the same wording as the subject line, or a slightly more detailed version of the subject line (for example, using "We received your VA form" in subject line and "We received your authorization to release medical information" in H1, to keep subject line in character limits)

### Feature card (also called block quote card)

* Use the feature card component to display important details, like confirmation numbers or the date of an upcoming appointment
* Only use 1 feature card in each email
* If the feature card displays information from an online form confirmation screen, make sure the data field labels (like "Date submitted") match between the feature card and the confirmation screen

### Links 

Follow these general rules for accessible link text:
* [Follow general VA style guidance for links](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links)
* Always include purpose and the destination in link text—for links from emails to the VA website, add "on VA.gov" as the destination
* Make each link a full sentence
* Put each link on a separate line
* Avoid “Click here,” since not all people are physically clicking links
* Avoid generic link text like “Learn more” and “Read more” by themselves
  * **Like this:** [Learn how to pay your copay bill on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)

Limit the number of links in each email:
* Only include a link if the Veteran needs it to complete the call to action or to find need-to-know information
* Try to use a single, clear call-to-action link, like "Submit your disability claim on VA.gov"
* Don't include more than 3 links total

If you're using VA Notify, use the analytics link generator for UTM tracking. 

### Footer 

* Use the footer to explain why we sent this email and tell people not to reply:
    * **Like this:** You’re receiving this email because you submitted a form on VA.gov. Don’t reply to this email.
