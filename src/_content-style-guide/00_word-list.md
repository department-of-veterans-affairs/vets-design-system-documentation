- We might use different capitalization or hyphenation.
- We may call for using a more plain language version of a word or to define it in body copy.  
- We may call for using a preferred version on VA.gov when different VA agencies use variations for the same word.

For terms that are not on this list, refer to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com).
