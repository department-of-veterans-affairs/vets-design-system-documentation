## How this section helps VA content creators ## 

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA content helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward creating a seamless customer experience across multiple communication channels and in multiple languages, consistency in content becomes even more important. 

The entries in this section can help guide teams  across VA as they create content about a specific topic or program.

The information within each entry is based on these factors: 

- VA content and plain language standards 
- Search and analytics research
