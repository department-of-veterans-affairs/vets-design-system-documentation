## Considerations

- We use the terms "claim," "application," and "request" throughout VA.gov intentionally, and they often aren't interchangeable.  
- In reusable content that appears in many types of applications, requests, and static pages (like an alert), use the general term "form" instead of "claim," "application," or "request" to avoid confusion.  
Like this: "Thank you for submitting your form on VA.gov"  
Not this: "Thank you for submitting your application on VA.gov"
- Existing pages on VA.gov may not always reflect the latest decisions documented here. If you have questions about any content, feel free to ask the content and information architecture (CAIA) team. 

## Related terms

**apply**
: We use this term in the context of someone submitting an initial application for benefits. In general, a Veteran will "apply" for any non-disability benefit (including pension and DIC benefits) and "file a claim" for disability.

**claim**
: In most cases we use this term in the context of someone filing a disability claim. We also use this term in the context of reimbursement and after someone applies for a benefit and has been judged eligible. For example, a Veteran may file a travel reimbursement claim. We use this term to reflect that Veterans who are filing for disability-or filing a claim for reimbursement-have a right to that compensation. 

Example: You apply for a disability rating. After you get your rating, you file a claim for your compensation.

**claim exam**
: We use claim exams to determine if a Veteran has a service-connected disability. We also use claim exams to rate that disability.
: - Note: This term is evolving. For now, on first mention on a page, use “VA claim exam (also known as a compensation and pension, or C&P, exam).” After first mention, use “VA claim exam” or “claim exam.”

**file**
: We use this term to refer to the actual file a Veteran is uploading from their device. These may not be “documents” as in .doc. They could be .pdf, .jpg, .png, or other file types.
: - Note: Button text on file upload screens should say "Upload file," not "Upload document" or "Upload evidence."

**document**
: We use this term to refer to the digital or paper item a Veteran is submitting as evidence.
: - Note: File input screens in form flows should use "document" in the screen header. For example, "Upload your supporting documents."

**evidence**
: We use evidence to refer to all documents and information you submit to support your claim or application. We define evidence as “supporting documents or information.” A document or information becomes evidence when it gets attached to claim or application.
