## Considerations

- As with all content on VA, we use clear, conversational language in digital forms. This complies with the Plain Writing Act of 2010 and the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experiences Act (21st Century IDEA). Learn more about legal considerations in the [plain language vs. legalese section of the design system](https://design.va.gov/templates/forms/#legalese-vs-plain-language).
- The teams who digitize forms are responsible for getting the language vetted and checked by the specific form subject matter experts.

**Note:** If you're looking for guidance on a specific form label, error message, or hint text, links to updated labels are in the [Form labels section](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/form-labels). These labels are guidance for a standard version. The specific labels you use may depend on the specific form you're working on and the subject matter experts you're working with.

## Patterns 

### Punctuation

Don't use punctuation in these instances:

Step titles
Example: Veteran personal information

Headers
Example: "Veteran's identification information" or "Tell us where we should send the information" would not have punctuation.

Error messages
Example: Enter a 10-digit phone number (with or without dashes)

Standard labels
Example: "Name" or "Phone number"

Responses on multiple choice
Example: I'm the Veteran's spouse

Additional info components
Example: Learn more about military base addresses

Hint text
Example: You may request up to 99 certificates

CTA links
Example: Find out if you're eligible (opens in new tab)

**Exceptions**

Normal body text uses standard punctuation. Example: We don't require that you submit anything with this form.

Add a question mark if the content is a question. Example: "Are you the Veteran?"

Use punctuation if the content is more than one full sentence. Example: "Select the responses that describe your living situation. You can select more than one."

### Voice 

Use active voice. In general, use second person questions with first person responses. 

Example: 

What caused this service-connected disability?

(radio button) My disability was caused by an injury or exposure during my military service.
(radio button) My disability was caused by an injury or exposure during training. 

### Yes or no questions

- In most cases, there should be 2 answer options for Yes and No questions: "Yes" and "No"
- In certain cases, you can have up to 4 answer options: "Yes," "No," "I don't know," and "I prefer not to answer"
- Don't restate the question wording in the answer options

Like this: Is the Veteran deceased? Yes [button] No [button]
Not like this: Is the Veteran deceased? Yes, the Veteran is deceased [button] No, the Veteran is not deceased [button]
