# Bold text

Use bolded text to call attention to words or phrases that will help the Veteran understand the content on the page.

**Note:** Don’t use italics. It doesn’t show up well on a screen, and sometimes it can be harder to read than normal text.

**Use bold text only in these cases**

- The explicit set-up line that comes before bullet points that states something like this: “Both of these must be true” (https://www.va.gov/pension/eligibility/)
- The “and” or “or” that comes at the end of each line in a bulleted list
- The first part of a sentence, for scanability, when there’s a need to clearly set apart, for instance Veterans who fall into different eligibility categories. [See this page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/)
- Numerals, for scanability, that we know the Veteran is on the page to look for—like a dollar figure. [See this page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/get-reimbursed-for-travel-pay/)
- The different types of accounts through which you can sign in to VA.gov: My HealtheVet, DS Logon, and ID.me. [See this page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/view-test-and-lab-results/)
- When there’s a “Note:” or “Example:” [See this page](https://www.va.gov/pension/veterans-pension-rates/)
- The design element or text link we want the user to click on when we’re walking them through online instructions. [See this page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/get-reimbursed-for-travel-pay/)

**Don’t use bold in these cases**

- Any part of a text link, since the blue and underlining sets apart that text enough
- Words used to emphasize a point being made in the text, like “only if”
