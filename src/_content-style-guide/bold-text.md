# Bold & italic text

## Bold text

Use bolded text to call attention to words or phrases that will help the Veteran understand the content on the page.

### Don’t use bold in these cases

- In any part of a text link, since the blue and underlining sets apart that text enough.
- For words used to emphasize a point being made in the text, like “only if.”
- When the label is serving as a subhead. Use an H3 or an H4 instead. Screen readers navigate around the page by headings. If the subhead text is regular bold text instead of a header, the screen reader will skip that section of the page.

### Use bold text in these cases
These are some examples of when we use bold in VA style.

- The explicit set-up line that comes before bullet points that states something like this: “Both of these must be true.” [Review examples on the Eligibility for Veterans Pension page](https://www.va.gov/pension/eligibility/)
- The “and” or “or” that comes at the end of each line in a bulleted list.
- The first part of a sentence, when there's a need to set it apart for scanability. For example, when the first parts of several sentences describe Veterans who fall into different eligibility categories. [Review examples on the Eligibility for VA health care page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/)
- Numerals that we know the Veteran is on the page to look for—like a dollar figure. [Review examples on the Disability housing grants for Veterans page](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/)
- The different types of sign-in accounts we accept or previously accepted on VA.gov: Login.gov, My HealtheVet, DS Logon, and ID.me. [Review examples on the View your VA lab and test results online page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/view-test-and-lab-results/)
- When there’s a “Note:” or “Example:” [Review examples on the VA pension rates for Veterans page](https://www.va.gov/pension/veterans-pension-rates/)
- The design element or text link we want the Veteran to select when we’re explaining how to do a task. For example, "In the **File** menu, select **Save**." [Review another example on the Verifying your identity page](https://www.va.gov/resources/verifying-your-identity-on-vagov/)
- If you’re presenting a series of label and value pairs, such as the contact information (address, phone number, etc.) for a location. The label is always bold, not the value, and the label and value are separated by a line break as opposed to a colon. [Review examples on the H. John Heinz III Department of VA Medical Center page](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/locations/h-john-heinz-iii-department-of-veterans-affairs-medical-center/#caregiver-support)

## Italic text

* **Don’t use italics.** It doesn’t show up well on a screen, and sometimes it can be harder to read than normal text.
