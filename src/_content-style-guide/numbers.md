# Numbers

We differ from AP Style on numbers in order to meet the needs of users on the web and on mobile. 

{% include _site-on-this-page.html %}

## Use numerals 
We use numerals or figures for all numbers, including 1 to 10. It's easier on the web and on mobile for scanning, and helpful to low-literacy readers and people whose first language isn’t English.

### Exceptions

- Spell out "one" when it's used by itself in a sentence, or in expressions like one-to-one, one-on-one, and one-time.
- Spell out ordinals up to tenth (first, second, third, etc.). Then use the style: 11th, 12th, etc. 
- When used as part of a series, date, or range, always default to numerals.

## Signs and symbols

We use certain symbols in content throughout VA. Well-known signs and symbols can be easier to scan. 

### Dollar sign
In general, use the dollar sign instead of spelling out dollars.  

**Example:** We’ll pay the tuition and mandatory fees up to $27,120.05 for this academic year (August 1, 2023, to July 31, 2024).

Add "$" to table cells so screenreaders read the number as dollars and cents and not as a standard decimal.

### Degree symbol
When pairing with a specific number, use the degree symbol.  

**Example:** The temperature was 10°C

### Percent sign 
Use numerals and % symbol, with no space between the number and %. This style follows the practice for scientific and technical writing, and differs from 18F.
