# Numbers

We differ from AP Style on numbers in order to meet the needs of users on the web and on mobile. 

{% include _site-on-this-page.html %}

## Use numerals 
We use numerals or figures for all numbers, including 1 to 10. It's easier on the web and on mobile for scanning, and helpful to low-literacy readers and people whose first language isn’t English.

## Exceptions

- Spell out "one" when it's used by itself in a sentence, or in expressions like one-to-one, one-on-one, and one-time.
- Spell out ordinals up to tenth (first, second, third, etc.). Then use the style: 11th, 12th, etc. 
- When used as part of a series or a range, always default to numerals.

## Percentages

Use numerals and % symbol, with no space between the number and %. This style follows the practice for scientific and technical writing, and differs from 18F. 

We use this approach because it’s easier to scan, and we have a lot of content discussing disability ratings. Disability ratings fall into the scientific and technical category of writing.

The monthly benefit amounts for a single Veteran with no children and a disability rating of 10% to 100% are: 

- 10% disability rating: &mdash;

- 20% disability rating: &mdash;

**Or**

If you have a 50% disability and a 30% disability, the combined disability rating is 65%.
