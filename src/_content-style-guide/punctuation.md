# Punctuation
We follow standard American English and AP Style on VA.gov. Areas where we differ are listed below.

#### Ampersands

Don't use ampersands (&) in headers or body copy. Spell out “and.” Exceptions are when it's part of a proper noun such as a program name. Example: VR&E program.

#### Commas

We use the serial comma, sometimes called the Oxford comma. This is the comma used before a conjunction in a sentence with a series of 3 or more items. Sometimes the sentence can be misread if the serial comma is omitted.


<div class="do-dont">
<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">

In his acceptance speech the actor thanked his parents, Martin Scorsese, and Robert De Niro.

</div>
</div>
<div class="do-dont__dont">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Not this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">

In his acceptance speech the actor thanked his parents, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro.

</div>
</div>
</div>





#### Contractions

We use contractions on VA.gov. It supports our conversational, person-to-person voice and tone. Some situations might call for spelling out all the words, like in legal or a warning messages, but in general, we prefer using contractions. 

- Be careful not to mix up "its" and "it's."
- Use "it's" as a contraction of "it is," never "it has." 
- Don't use non-standard contractions like "would've," "could've," or "should've."


<div class="do-dont">
<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
We're available 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. CT, Monday through Friday. 

</div>

<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">

</div>
</div>
</div>





#### Em and en dashes, hyphens

__Em dash__ 

Use the em dash similar to a parenthetical or commas to set off an important clause, when commas might be awkward. Try not to over use them. We don't use a space on either side of the em dash. 

- **Like this:** You may be eligible if you have an illness or injury caused&mdash;or made worse by&mdash;your time in service.

__En dash__ 

We use the en dash to indicate a range. We use a space on either side of the en dash.
- **Like this:** 9:00 a.m. ‒ 5:30 p.m. CT

__Hyphens__ 

This is the short, single dash. We use it to connect words that modify a noun or in names. 
- **Like this:** active-duty service member; VA-related claim; Merriam-Webster 





#### Exclamation points

Don't use the exclamation point on VA.gov for any text elements (body copy, headers, subheaders, field labels, CTAs, etc.). It doesn't align withour voice and tone, which is conversational, helpful, and straightforward. We don't yell, and we're not hyperbolic or casual.

<div class="do-dont">
<div class="do-dont__do">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Like this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
Section header example:
  
__Find out what happens after you apply__

Or

__After you apply__

</div>
</div>
<div class="do-dont__dont">
<h3 class="do-dont__heading">Not this</h3>
<div class="do-dont__content" markdown="1">
Section header example:
  
__You're enrolled! Now what?__

Or

__You've successfully applied!__

</div>
</div>
</div>

Note: Some design components may use the exclamation point as an icon for visual accent — in alert components, for example — but don't use it in the message copy itself.
