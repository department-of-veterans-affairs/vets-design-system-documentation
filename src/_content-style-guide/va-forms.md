# VA forms

/[TO DISCUSS: Text taken from Andy's USCIS Content Guide. We should adapt this style for VA form names on va.gov. Putting 'VA Form' in front of all forms seems not easy to scan. Unless there's some very special VA reason? In general, all government form names are super long, and VA forms don't appear to be more unusually so./Jen]/ 

Form numbers are always used as a secondary reference on myUSCIS. We break from the syle used on USCIS' main website (i.e., *Form N-400, Application for Naturalization*) by dropping the word *form* and putting the number after the title in parenthesis. We need to maintain the form number for parity with the paper form, user recall, and SEO, but it is not a central organizing feature on myUSCIS or for many of our users.

Always include the form number in parenthesis on first reference on each page. You do not need to include it on subsequent references. You also do not need to include it if the form number is displayed to users as a visual element.

> `Do:` *Application for Naturalization (N-400)*

> `Don't:` *Form N-400, Application for Naturalization; N-400 Application for Naturalization; N-400: Application for Naturalization*

# Government Forms (Applications) Referenced on vets.gov

When referring to a form, include "VA Form" in front of the number of the form and cap the F in "Form." For example, "Download VA Form 82-3456."

When referred to in a sentence, lead with the name of the form (preceded by the article "a" or "an" rather than "the") followed by the number of the form in parentheses. Then, to link to the PDF, use the form number again for the sake of brevity:

E.g. Fill out an Application for Burial Benefits (VA Form 21P-530). [Download VA Form 21P-530](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21P-530-ARE.pdf).
