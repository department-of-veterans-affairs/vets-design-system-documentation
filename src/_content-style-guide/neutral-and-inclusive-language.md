title: Neutral and inclusive language
intro-text: At VA, we aim to create language that’s accurate for all our audiences. That means using language that’s neutral and inclusive for Veterans and family members of different experiences, identities, and abilities. We focus on the intent of the action rather than the specific way a person experiences that action.

## Gender-neutral pronouns and terms for family relationships 

### We use “they” and “their” as gender-neutral pronouns

Don’t use “he or she” or “his or her.”

### We use gender-neutral terms for family relationships

-	Spouse or partner instead of husband or wife
-	Child or dependent child instead of son or daughter
-	Stepchild instead of stepson or stepdaughter
-	Parent instead of mother or father

**Note:** Some VA forms currently capture gendered relationships on their backend, so we may need to keep gendered terms in some online forms until VA is able to adjust the backend.

## Language that doesn’t assume an ability or device

### We avoid “view” and “hear” 

A person viewing a screen would “view" their medical records, lab results, claim status, or letter. A person using a screen reader or calling in to listen to an interactive voice response experience would “hear” their medical records, lab results, claim status, or letter. 

So, we use language that focuses on the intent of the action rather than the sensory experience. This becomes especially important as we create flexible and reusable content that can work across different channels.

Examples:

-	Go to your medical records
-	Review your lab results
-	Check your claim status
-	Read your letter  
-	Play our video

### We avoid “click,” “press,” and “tap”

People can use several different types of interactions for the same task. So, we use “select” instead of “click,” “press,” or “tap.” 

Examples: 

-	In buttons, use “Select **Submit**” instead of “Tap the **Submit** button”
-	In links and navigation, use “Select **My VA**” instead of “Click on **My VA**”
-	In phone extensions, use “Select 1” instead of “Press 1” 
 
### We avoid directional language

Content won’t always be in the same place on a screen for all people, so we avoid directional language in instructions. For example, different screen sizes on mobile devices, different assistive devices, and different text size settings can all affect the placement of content.

### We avoid language that references color

Many people have colorblindness, so we avoid using color in instructions.

## First-person language instead of specific roles and titles

### We avoid specific titles of VA business lines or offices

The internal organization of VA is usually not need-to-know information for Veterans. So in most cases, we use “we” and “us” to refer to VA as a whole. Don’t use VBA, VHA, NCA, or other internal VA acronyms.

### We avoid or minimize branded program names

In most cases, we describe the program or benefit instead.

### We avoid specific titles of VA staff roles

Just like with business offices, specific job titles of VA staff members are usually not need-to-know information for Veterans.

We only include job titles or staff roles when the Veteran needs to know that specific term to contact the right person at a facility. For example, “Call your VA facility and ask for the My HealtheVet coordinator.”
