### April 25, 2022

- System wide navigation changes
  - The side navigation now shows sub-pages rather than in-page anchor links. Anchor links are now reflected using the "On this page" component which you'll find at the top of any lengthy page.
  - Experimental Design components and patterns moved into their respective Components and Patterns sections.
  - The "Documentation" section was renamed "About".
  - The "Design" section was renamed "Foundation".
  - Utilities and Layout moved into the Foundation section.
- [Maturity scale]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/maturity-scale): We've introduced a maturity scale to track the lifecycle of components and patterns. This allows experimental design elements to come into the system and have visibility in the Components and Patterns sections. Each component and pattern has been assigned a maturity level on the scale which is indicated by a tag and dot in the side navigation.
- Section pages: Top-level navigation sections, such as Patterns and Foundation, now have sub-sections that group similar elements. For example, [Patterns > Forms]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/forms/) groups form patterns where each form pattern has a distinct page and a similar page structure. These new section pages will also have general guidance that applies to everything in that section. This will allow us to grow the system. 
  - New sections:
    - [Foundation > Layout]({{ site.baseurl }}/foundation/layout/) 
    - [Foundation > Utilities]({{ site.baseurl }}/foundation/utilities/) 
    - [Patterns > Forms]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/forms/) 
    - [Patterns > Templates]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/templates/)
