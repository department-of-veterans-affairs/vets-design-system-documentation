# Updating this site

<div class="va-introtext">
  Do you need to update content or add something to this site?
</div>

To make or suggest an update to this site, you can use its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation).

The [wiki](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/wiki) includes helpful instructions about how to write new content for this site, including:
- [New page templates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/wiki/Adding-content)
- [HTML snippets](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/wiki/Writing-snippets) for enhanced content presentation

You can make updates directly in GitHub without any expertise in writing code as long as you write with markdown. When you are done with your work, create a new branch and submit a pull request.  

Watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXwhzUg1lKA) if you need to make multiple changes at one time like adding an image to a page. If you try to add an image to a page directly in GitHub you would have to create two pull request. A better option would be to bundle the image and edits to the page into one pull request. An added benefit to bundling your changes is being able to preview all your changes in one place. Follow the instructions below for more information on previewing your pull request. 

### Preview your changes

When making updates to documentation you can preview your changes before publishing them to the live site. When you create a pull request or a draft pull request, a preview link is created where you can view the entire documentation site with the changes that submitted before publishing those changes to the live site. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation?tab=readme-ov-file#previewing-pull-requests) or watch this [demo on YouTube (9:41)](https://youtu.be/kXwhzUg1lKA?feature=shared&t=581) to see the preview link in action. 

Use the Preview pull request feature to share your changes with others before submitting
