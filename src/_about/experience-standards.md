intro-text: The VA.gov Experience Standards are the criteria that the Governance team will use to assess VFS products for design, IA, content, and accessibility as VFS teams bring their work through the Collaboration Cycle.

Each experience standard is framed around the end-user experience (Veterans, family, caregivers, or members of the public). Issues flagged under these experience standards will result in a degraded experience for at least some users.

## Using the Standards

Governance team references these standards when we review products during the Collaboration Cycle, and especially at [staging reviews](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/staging-review). See [Anatomy of a Staging Review Issue Ticket](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/anatomy-of-a-staging-review-issue-ticket) for an example of how findings are reported.

**VFS teams** should use these standards as a helpful tool as you build your product. At any point during your product’s lifecycle, you can use each standard as a self-check to verify that you’re building a product that meets the needs of your users.
