## For designers

Sketch is our tool of choice for creating mockups. You can access our sketch library with the link below. New updates to the sketch library will be announced on the #design slack channel. If you encounter any bugs (or think of any improvements!) with the sketch library please write a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/new/choose).

</ul>


Design teams at VA use [Sketch for Teams](https://www.sketch.com/for-teams/) to view, share, and collaborate on our work. Only designers actively working on products at VA.gov can be added to Sketch for Teams.

Sketch for Teams works very similar to "normal" Sketch, but contains a few big features that help teams work together:

- Files (including libraries) live in the cloud, rather than locally on your machine
- You can see what everyone else is doing
- You receive Library updates automagiclly
- Developers can inspect any element on a page, anytime

To read more documentation on how to use sketch for teams, check our our [for designers documentation](https://design.va.gov/documentation/designers)
