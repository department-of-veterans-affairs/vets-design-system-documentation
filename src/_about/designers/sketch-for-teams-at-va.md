## Get added to Sketch for Teams

1. Go to [sketch.com](https://www.sketch.com/signup) and create a Sketch account. 
2. In the [#design channel in Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C0NGDDXME), ping a Sketch for Teams admin (currently {{ site.sketch_for_teams_admin }}) requesting to be added.
3. Receive the invite via email, accept the invitation.
4. Boom, you're in! 

## Using Sketch for Teams

Sketch for Teams contains a few important features that help teams work together:

- Files (including libraries) live in the cloud, rather than locally on your machine
- You receive library updates automatically (a big advantage of using Sketch for Teams)
- You can see what everyone else is working on in the VA workspace
- Developers can inspect any element on a page

To get started on a new project, there are only a couple of steps:

1. Duplicate and rename the [Sketch for Teams Template](https://www.sketch.com/s/2f665c26-160d-474e-b5cc-bb94e73bb91a) in your team's folder.
2. In the Sketch app, go to Sketch > Preferences > Libraries and add the [Component Library - MVP]({{ site.sketch_component_library }}).

## Leaving Sketch for Teams

People change projects frequently, and we have a limited number of licenses for Sketch for Teams. If you roll off work at VA or no longer use Sketch for Teams, please email {{ site.sketch_for_teams_admin }}.
