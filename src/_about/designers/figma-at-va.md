Only designers actively working on products at VA.gov can be added to the VA Figma account. Once you have been added, you may access the [{{design_library_name}}]({{site.figma_component_library}}).

## Get added to Figma

For more information, see [Designing with Figma at VA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/designing-with-figma-at-va) and [Requesting access to Figma](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/figma-accounts-at-va)

## Using Figma

Figma contains a few important features that help teams work together:

- Files (including libraries) live in the cloud, rather than locally on your machine
- You receive library updates automatically (a big advantage of using Figma)
- You can see what everyone else is working on in the VA workspace
- Developers can inspect any element on a page

To get started on a new project, there are only a couple of steps:

1. Create a new design file or duplicate from [Templates, Patterns, and Forms](https://www.figma.com/file/4A3O3mVx4xDAKfHE7fPF1U/VADS-Templates%2C-Patterns%2C-and-Forms?type=design&node-id=2988%3A29745&mode=design&t=Cyllgq48PAHpl8J9-1) in your team's Figma project.
2. In Figma, go to the **Assets** panel, to view the core components from {{ site.design_library_name }} .

## Leaving Figma

People change projects frequently, and we have a limited number of licenses for Figma. If you roll off work at VA or no longer use Figma, please email {{ site.sketch_for_teams_admin }}.
