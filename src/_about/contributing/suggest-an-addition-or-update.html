<h2 id="suggest-an-addition-or-update">Suggest an addition or update</h2>

<p>If you believe your component or pattern will be a good candidate for inclusion in the design system, then you may suggest an addition or update to begin the experimental design process. This process may begin with feedback received at a Collaboration Cycle touchpoint, and will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conducting research to validate your design</li>
  <li>Presenting your design work and your research to the Design System Council</li>
  <li>Receiving approval from the Design System Council to be added to the design system</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If your component or pattern is approved by the Design System Council, you may then <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/contributing-to-the-design-system/add-a-component-or-pattern-once-approved">add a component or pattern to the design system</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Once a need is identified, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Check the design system and backlog</strong>: Ensure your idea does not already exist or is not already requested.</li>
  <li><strong>Submit a request</strong>: Fill out the Experimental Design System request issue, providing justification and any relevant artifacts.</li>
  <li><strong>Conduct research</strong>: Validate your proposal with user research. Share findings with the Design System Team.</li>
  <li><strong>Review and feedback</strong>: Present to the Design System Council (Governance Team) for review and feedback. You may request asynchronous review for minor changes.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="add-component-or-pattern">Add a component or pattern once approved</h2>
<p>
  After approval, the VFS Team works with the Design System Team to implement the new or updated component or pattern. Ensure documentation is updated and all requirements from the Governance Team are met.
</p>

<h2 id="new-component-or-pattern">New component or pattern</h2>

<p>
  Proposing a new component or pattern is appropriate if you have an idea for something that should be 
  included in the design system, or if you receive feedback in the Collaboration Cycle that your work 
  may be useful for other teams. Note that the experimental design process is only necessary when a 
  component or pattern will be useful for other VFS teams. Custom components and patterns that will be 
  used only in your product do not need to go through this process.

    <p>
      As you build your component or pattern, check the design system and ensure it does not already exist. 
      If your addition overlaps with a current component or pattern, be sure to call that out when you file 
      your request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, check the backlog to see if your idea has already been suggested.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you do see your idea in the backlog, comment on that ticket indicating that you have a need for 
        the component. You will need to wait until the Design System Team is able to continue work on this 
        ticket. Do not file a new experimental design request.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you do not see your idea in the backlog, you may continue with filing your request.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <va-process-list-item
    header="Fill out a request"
    level="3"
  >
    <p>
      Fill out an Experimental Design System request issue. This should take no more than 10-15 minutes. 
      In the issue you will need to provide justification for this new component or pattern, and link to 
      any artifacts you want to include.
    </p>
    <p>
      <va-link-action
        href="{{ site.request_addition_link }}"
        text="Request a new addition to the Design System"
        type="secondary"
      ></va-link-action>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you feel the addition is small and well explained in your issue, then you may request an 
      <a href="#async-review">asynchronous review</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that you do not need to have anything coded at this point, and in fact, we suggest not having 
      anything coded since ideally ideas would be surfaced to the council before teams put effort into 
      building new components.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the artifacts you include do not need to be high fidelity. They only need to be able 
      to illustrate your concept. We do, however, encourage some thoughts on how your component or pattern 
      works on mobile.    
    </p>

  <va-process-list-item

    <p>
      You must validate the design of your new component or pattern with user research. 
      <a href="https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-at-va">Learn about 
      conducting research at VA.</a> You may conduct research before presenting your work to the Design System 
      Council, or you may present to the Design System Council and receive feedback before you complete a 
      research study. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that even if the Design System Council approves your component or pattern before you conduct 
      research, you must still validate your work with user research and provide your findings to the 
      Design System Council before it can be included in the design system. After research is complete, 
      attach your findings to your Experimental Design request issue, post in the 
      <a href="{{ site.slack_channel_link }}">{{ site.slack_channel_name }}</a> Slack channel and tag 
      Carol Wong to alert the team.
    </p>
  </va-process-list-item>
  <va-process-list-item
    header="Present to Design System Council"
    level="3"

    <p>
      You will present your work to the Design System Council at an upcoming meeting (unless you have 
      requested an <a href="#async-review">asynchronous review</a>). The Design System Council meets 
      every other Thursday at 11am Eastern. Experimental design requests will always be prioritized in 
      this meeting, and teams can assume generally that they will be able to present the same week of 
      the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are ready to present, post in the 
      <a href="{{ site.slack_channel_link }}">{{ site.slack_channel_name }}</a> Slack channel and tag 
      Carol Wong to alert the team that you have filled out an issue and would like to get on the 
      council's agenda. During the meeting, the Design System Council will evaluate the request and 
      make a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If your component or pattern request is rejected</strong>, the council will add notes as 
      to why and what they suggest you do instead in the issue.

<h2 id="async-review">Asynchronous review</h2>
<p>
  If you feel like the change is simple and does not need further explanation beyond what you have provided in your issue then you may ask to have asynchronous approval when creating the initial request.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your addition will still be discussed in the council meeting, but you do not have to attend.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Design System Council may still request additional information from you in order to properly handle your request.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="update-an-existing-component-or-pattern">
  Update an existing component or pattern
</h2>
<p>
  If you are suggesting a change to something that already exists in the VA.gov Design System, 
  you should go through the <a href="#new-component-or-pattern">New component or pattern</a> process above. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Minor changes:</strong> If you are requesting a minor change, a change which you feel would be 
    a minor adjustment to current functionality, then you may request an asynchronous review. To do so, 
    complete <a href="#new-component-or-pattern">the process</a> above and indicate in your request that 
    you would like an asynchronous review by the Design System Council.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bugs:</strong> If the change you are requesting is a bug in a component or pattern 
    <a href="{{ site.github_issues_new }}">file an issue</a>. For example, if the behavior of the component 
    does not match our documentation or a component is not behaving as expected. If the Design System Team 
    feels the matter needs to be addressed by the Design System Council, we'll let you know in the issue.
  </li>
</ul>
