# Figma at VA

The VA.gov Design System uses Figma as the collaborative design platform for teams actively working on VA products.

## Access requirements

Only designers actively involved with VA.gov products can join the VA Figma account. Contact your team lead or review the DEPO platform documentation for requesting access.

## Key features

Figma provides these collaborative capabilities:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Cloud storage | Files (including libraries) live in the cloud, rather than locally on your machine |
| Automatic updates | You receive library updates automatically |
| Workspace visibility | Team members can observe ongoing work across the VA workspace |
| Developer inspection | Developers can examine individual page elements |

## Getting started

New projects require minimal setup:

1. Create a new file or duplicate existing templates from the "VADS Templates, Patterns, and Forms" file in your team workspace
2. Access core components through the Assets panel in the VADS Component Library

## Design libraries

The VA Design System provides several Figma libraries:

- **VADS Component Library** - Core UI components
- **VADS Templates, Patterns, and Forms** - Page templates and form patterns
- **VADS Annotation Kit** - Accessibility annotation tools

## Offboarding procedure

When staff transition away from Figma or VA projects, they should follow the documented offboarding procedure to release limited Figma licenses.

- Designing with Figma at VA (DEPO documentation)
- Requesting access to Figma (DEPO platform documentation)
