# Contributing to the Design System

The VA.gov Design System welcomes contributions from Veteran-facing teams. This guide explains how to propose new components, patterns, or improvements.

## Before You Begin

Teams should use existing design system patterns and components when possible. New components or patterns require approval through the Experimental Design process.

### When to Contribute

Consider contributing when:

- Your component or pattern could benefit multiple VA.gov products
- Existing components don't solve your user problem sufficiently
- You've identified a significant gap in the design system

### Contribution Criteria

A component or pattern is a good candidate if it meets these standards:

1. **Multi-product utility** - The component will be useful in multiple products on VA.gov, with documented use cases beyond a single product

2. **Significant differentiation** - The component differs substantially from existing designs—not merely in color or format variations

3. **Unmet user needs** - Existing components and patterns won't solve the user problems sufficiently

## Contribution Process

### Phase 1: Collaboration Cycle

1. **Identify the need** - Document why existing components/patterns don't work
2. **Research** - Gather evidence for the user need
3. **Initial proposal** - Create a brief proposal for review
4. **Design System Team review** - Get initial feedback

### Phase 2: Submission & Review

1. **Submit your request** - Use the contribution request form
2. **Provide documentation** - Include research, designs, and use cases
3. **Review process** - The governance team evaluates the proposal
4. **Iterate** - Address feedback and refine the design

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. **Develop** - Build the approved component/pattern
2. **Test** - Ensure accessibility and cross-browser compatibility
3. **Document** - Write usage guidelines and examples
4. **Deploy** - Release to the design system

## Roles & Responsibilities

### VFS Teams (Veteran-Facing Services)

- Propose and research components/patterns
- Provide use cases and documentation
- Implement approved designs
- Participate in review process

### Design System Team

- Review proposals and provide feedback
- Support teams through the contribution process
- Maintain quality standards
- Manage releases

### Governance Team

- Make final approval decisions
- Ensure alignment with design system strategy
- Balance consistency with innovation

## Documentation Contributions

Teams can contribute directly to design system documentation through GitHub.

### How to Contribute Docs

1. **Fork the repository** - Create your own copy
2. **Make changes** - Edit or add documentation
3. **Submit a pull request** - Request review of your changes
4. **Address feedback** - Make requested revisions
5. **Merge** - Changes are published after approval

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, plain language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Provide accessibility guidance
- Follow the existing structure and format

## Best Practices

### Start Early

Begin the contribution process during the design phase, before development begins. Early engagement helps avoid rework.

### Provide Evidence

Support your proposal with:

- User research findings
- Analytics data
- Use cases from multiple products
- Competitive analysis

### Be Collaborative

Work with the Design System Team throughout the process. They can help refine your proposal and increase its chances of approval.

### Think Beyond Your Product

Design for reusability. Consider how other teams might use your component in different contexts.
