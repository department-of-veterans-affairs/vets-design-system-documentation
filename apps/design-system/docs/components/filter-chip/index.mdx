title: Filter chip
description: A compact element that allows users to filter content by selecting or deselecting criteria
maturity: use-with-caution
platforms:
  - web
  - mobile
usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Filtering lists or search results**: Use filter chips when users need to narrow down content based on multiple criteria"
    - value: "**Tag-based filtering**: When content is categorized with tags that users can select to filter"
    - value: "**Multi-select filters**: When users should be able to apply multiple filters simultaneously"
  when_to_consider_else:
    - value: "**Single selection**: If only one option can be selected at a time, consider radio buttons or a select dropdown"
    - value: "**Primary actions**: Don't use filter chips for primary actions; use buttons instead"
    - value: "**Navigation**: Use tabs or links for navigation between different views"
  behavior:
    - value: Filter chips toggle between selected and unselected states when clicked
    - value: Selected chips should have a distinct visual treatment (e.g., filled background, checkmark icon)
    - value: Chips should be dismissible when in the selected state
    - value: Changes should be reflected immediately in the filtered content
content_considerations:
  - value: Keep chip labels short and descriptive (1-3 words)
  - value: Use sentence case for labels
  - value: Be specific about what the filter does
  - value: Avoid jargon or technical terms users won't understand
accessibility:
  - value: Chips should announce their label and current state (selected/not selected)
  - value: State changes should be announced when toggled
  - value: Use `aria-pressed` to indicate the selected state
  - value: Ensure sufficient color contrast for both states
