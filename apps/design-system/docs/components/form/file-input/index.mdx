usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: Allow users to upload documents or files as part of a form
    - value: Require file attachments for application submissions
    - value: Need to collect specific file types (PDFs, images, etc.)
  when_to_consider_else:
    - value: Users need simultaneous multi-file selection (the component processes one file per interaction)
    - value: iOS mobile file selection is critical without accepting single-file workarounds
  behavior:
    - value: "**Trigger**: Button activation opens OS file dialog"
    - value: "**Upload feedback**: Success/failure messages appear post-upload"
    - value: "**Removal**: Users can delete uploaded files"
    - value: "**Progress tracking**: Progress bar should indicate server-side uploads"
content_considerations:
  - value: "\"Upload\" instead of \"Add\""
  - value: "\"Delete\" instead of \"Remove\""
  - value: "\"File\" instead of \"Document\" (broader applicability)"
