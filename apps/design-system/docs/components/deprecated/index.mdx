## Deprecated component list

| Component | Status | Replacement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| [Banner - Promo](./banner-promo) | Deprecated | [Banner](../banner/) |
| [Input message](./input-message) | Deprecated | [Alert](../alert/) (slim variant) |
| [Notification](./notification) | Deprecated | [Alert](../alert/) |

## Migration guidance

### Banner - Promo → Banner

The promotional banner variant has been consolidated into the standard Banner component. Use the default Banner component for all banner needs.

### Input message → Alert (slim)

Input messages for form validation feedback should now use the slim variant of the Alert component:

```html
<va-alert status="error" slim>
  <p>Please enter a valid email address.</p>
</va-alert>
```

### Notification → Alert

General notifications should use the Alert component with the appropriate status:

```html
<va-alert status="info" visible>
  <h2 slot="headline">Important update</h2>
  <p>Your information has been saved.</p>
</va-alert>
```
