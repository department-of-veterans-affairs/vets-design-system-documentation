  - value: "**Success messages**: Use 2-3 words like \"Draft saved\", \"Appointment canceled\""
  - value: "**Error messages**: Add \"not\" to success copy—\"Draft not saved\""
  - value: Avoid words like "successful" or "failed"
  - value: No punctuation required
  - value: Keep messages brief and action-oriented
accessibility:
  - value: Must not auto-close; users control dismissal timing
  - value: Screen readers announce snackbar as an Alert immediately upon display
  - value: Each action button is announced as a separate button
  - value: Positioned above bottom navigation to remain accessible and visible
  - value: Color contrast meets accessibility requirements for both success and error states
