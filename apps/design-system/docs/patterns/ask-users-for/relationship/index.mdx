intro: Use this pattern when collecting relationship information from non-Veterans, such as caregivers or family members completing forms on behalf of a Veteran.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Non-Veteran applicants.** When collecting relationship information from caregivers or family members filling out applications."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**Use dropdown or radio buttons.** Either form control works equally well for this pattern."
    - value: "**Standard options.** Include: Spouse, Child, Parent, Executor/Administrator, or Other."
    - value: "**Always provide Other.** Include an 'Other' option for relationships not fitting standard categories."
    - value: "**Use conditional reveals.** Implement conditionally revealed fields to reduce visual clutter."
    - value: "**Limit reveals per page.** Limit conditional reveals to one per page for clarity."
    - value: "**Place trigger last.** Place the option that triggers a reveal last to support keyboard navigation."

examples:
  - title: Relationship dropdown
    description: Dropdown menu with standard relationship options and Other.
  - title: Relationship radio buttons
    description: Radio button list with conditional text field for Other option.

how_to_build:
  intro: The relationship pattern uses either dropdown or radio buttons with conditional fields.
  steps:
    - value: "Choose dropdown or radio buttons based on form context."
    - value: "Include standard options: Spouse, Child, Parent, Executor/Administrator, Other."
    - value: "For 'Other' option, use a conditionally revealed text field."
    - value: "Use self-explanatory labels for revealed fields (avoid generic 'Other' labels)."
    - value: "Craft specific prompts like 'Since your relationship with the Veteran was not listed, please describe it here.'"
    - value: "Create distinct error messages for main fields and revealed fields."
  components_used:
    - name: Radio button
      url: /docs/components/form/radio-button
    - name: Select
      url: /docs/components/form/select
    - name: Text input
      url: /docs/components/form/text-input

content_specs:
  - field: Relationship to Veteran
    hint_text: null
    error_message: Please select your relationship to the Veteran
  - field: Other relationship (revealed)
    hint_text: null
    error_message: Please describe your relationship to the Veteran

accessibility:
  - value: "Ensure newly revealed fields are keyboard-accessible."
  - value: "Tab order should flow naturally into revealed content."
  - value: "Maintain separate error states for main and conditional fields."
  - value: "Focus should move to the revealed field when it appears."
