intro: Use this pattern to structure error messages that help users understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue. This applies to system-level errors, not inline form field validation.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**System-level errors.** When users encounter errors that prevent them from completing a task."
    - value: "**Clear recovery path.** When you need to explain the problem and provide actionable recovery steps."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**Two-step structure.** Step 1: Explain the problem. Step 2: Provide recovery steps."
    - value: "**Keep titles short.** Keep alert titles to 50 characters maximum."
    - value: "**Use neutral tone.** If user caused error, use neutral tone without blame."
    - value: "**Be specific and actionable.** Make recovery steps clear, specific, and actionable."
    - value: "**Coordinate with support.** Coordinate new error messages with Veteran Support team."

examples:
  - title: VA system error
    description: Alert explaining a VA system problem with recovery steps.
  - title: User action error
    description: Neutral alert explaining what went wrong with steps to fix.

how_to_build:
  intro: Error messages follow a two-step structure for clarity.
  steps:
    - value: "**Step 1 - Explain the problem:** Use alert component with explanation in header."
    - value: "If VA caused error: 'We're sorry. There's a problem with our system...'"
    - value: "If user caused error: Use neutral tone without blame."
    - value: "**Step 2 - Provide recovery steps:** Make steps clear, specific, and actionable."
    - value: "Provide contact option as secondary step if needed."
    - value: "Include links or buttons when necessary."
