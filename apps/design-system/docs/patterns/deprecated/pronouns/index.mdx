intro: This pattern was designed to ask Veterans for their pronouns in order to address them appropriately. The current policy recommends against using this pattern.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Appropriate addressing.** When you need to collect a person's pronouns in order to address them appropriately."
    - value: "**User comfort.** Allowing users to choose their pronouns creates a more comfortable interaction."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**Multiple selection.** Use checkboxes so that Veterans can identify with multiple descriptions."
    - value: "**Opt-out option.** Provide checkbox labeled 'Use my preferred name'."
    - value: "**Custom entry.** Allow for users to provide their own answer with an open-ended text field."
  when_not_to_use:
    - value: "**Policy recommendation.** The current policy recommends against using this pattern."

examples:
  - title: Pronoun selection
    description: Checkboxes allowing Veterans to select multiple pronoun options.
  - title: Custom pronoun entry
    description: Text field for users to provide their own pronoun.
