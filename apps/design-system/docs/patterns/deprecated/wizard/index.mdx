intro: The wizard pattern was designed to guide users through complex VA benefit eligibility pathways. It is deprecated due to difficult-to-solve accessibility issues. Use the "Complete a sub-task" pattern instead.

usage:
  when_to_use:
    - value: "**Complex eligibility.** Previously used to help users understand complex eligibility requirements for VA benefits."
    - value: "**One question at a time.** Presented one question at a time to avoid showing irrelevant content."
    - value: "**Branching logic.** Used branching logic to direct users to optimal pathways based on their circumstances."
  design_principles:
    - value: "**Deprecated.** This pattern is deprecated due to accessibility issues."
    - value: "**Use sub-task pattern.** Replace with the 'Complete a sub-task' pattern."
  when_not_to_use:
    - value: "**All new implementations.** Do not use this pattern for any new implementations."
    - value: "**Accessibility concerns.** This pattern has difficult-to-solve accessibility issues that negatively impact screen reader users and keyboard navigation."

examples:
  - title: Eligibility wizard
    description: Series of plain-language questions with conditional logic determining next questions.

how_to_build:
  intro: This pattern is deprecated. Use the "Complete a sub-task" pattern instead.
  steps:
    - value: "This pattern is deprecated and should not be used in new implementations."
    - value: "Replace with the 'Complete a sub-task' pattern."
    - value: "Contact the Design System Council or CollabCycle team for implementation guidance."
  components_used:
    - name: Button
      url: /docs/components/button
    - name: Radio button
      url: /docs/components/form/radio-button

content_considerations:
  - value: "For teams unable to immediately migrate, minimize accessibility issues by asking qualifying questions upfront in forms."
  - value: "Keep newly added content below triggering elements."
  - value: "Limit added content to one question or clarification."
  - value: "Avoid static content between interactive elements."
  - value: "Consult accessibility specialists for complex branching scenarios."

accessibility:
  - value: "**Screen reader issues.** New content added via conditional logic wasn't properly announced to screen readers."
  - value: "**No clear endpoint.** No clear endpoint for the wizard experience."
  - value: "**Tab navigation.** Users could accidentally tab out of the wizard flow."
  - value: "**Nested fieldsets.** Nested fieldsets created confusion as screen readers don't announce fieldset endings."
  - value: "**Dynamic content.** Dynamic show/hide behavior for results was unreliable for assistive technology."
