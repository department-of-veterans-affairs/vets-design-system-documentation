# Page titles and section titles

A good test for titles: hide all page text except titles and primary CTAs. If the page purpose remains clear, the titles are effective.

## Page titles

### Primary functions

Page titles serve two critical purposes:

1. **Clearly and quickly tell people the main purpose of the page** - what they can do or what information they can get
2. **Optimize the page for search** - so the information is findable through Google and other search engines

### Character limits

| Content type | Character limit |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Standard pages | 52 characters (including spaces) |
| Resources and support articles | 70 characters |
| News releases, blog titles, community stories, local events | No limit |

### Best practices

- Include the primary SEO keyword in the page title
- Use H1 tag for page titles on VA.gov
- Keep titles focused on the single main purpose of the page

## Section titles

### Best practices

- Structure with H2s for sections and H3s for subsections, maintaining natural hierarchy
- For multiple contact or application options, use "Option [X]:" in the header
- Keep section titles under 70 characters (including spaces)
- Eliminate unnecessary details from titles; address nuance in body copy

### Example structure

```
H1: How to apply for college

  H2: Documents you need before you start your college application

  H2: Ways to apply to colleges
    H3: Option 1: Online
    H3: Option 2: By mail
```

Headers provide clear guideposts and bring people deeper into the content.

## Privacy guidance

Page titles (H1s) can include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI), but this information can't be populated or tracked anywhere else.

**When including PII/PHI in page titles:**

- Exclude such information from URLs, parameters, and anchor tags
- Genericize corresponding breadcrumb segments
- Genericize title tags to prevent analytics tracking

This creates an accessibility trade-off. The VA 508 office has approved this approach.
