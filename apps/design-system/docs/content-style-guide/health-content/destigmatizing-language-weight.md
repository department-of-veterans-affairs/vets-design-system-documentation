# Destigmatizing language for weight

The VA emphasizes using respectful, person-first language when discussing weight-related health. Obesity is a complex chronic disease, not a choice.

## Key principles

1. **Person-first language** that doesn't define individuals by conditions
2. **Scientific understanding** of obesity rather than framing it as a personal failure
3. **Empathetic language** that conveys support without judgment

## Visual communication standards

### Avoid images that

- Emphasize body parts or show people without faces
- Depict stereotypical unhealthy behaviors
- Present foods negatively

### Choose images that

- Show diverse activities, roles, and careers
- Feature diverse backgrounds (gender, age, race/ethnicity)
- Display people in well-fitted clothing

### Image selection questions

Before using an image, ask:
- Does it reinforce negative stereotypes?
- Does it maintain the person's dignity?
- Who might find it offensive and why?
- Are there better alternatives?
