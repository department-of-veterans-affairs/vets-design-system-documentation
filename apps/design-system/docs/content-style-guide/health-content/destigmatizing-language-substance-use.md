# Destigmatizing language in substance use

Stigmatizing language can make it harder for people with substance use disorder to seek treatment. This guidance reflects four key commitments:

1. Recognize people as human beings first, not defined by conditions
2. Acknowledge that people have problems but aren't themselves the problem
3. Show support rather than negativity, blame, or punishment
4. Treat substance use disorder as a serious medical condition, not a choice
