# Health content

Health content should be accurate, accessible, and actionable to help Veterans make informed decisions about their health and healthcare benefits. VA health writing uses a person-to-person, empathetic, and conversational voice rather than clinical language.

## Plain language for medical terms

Replace medical jargon with everyday language or explain clinical terms in context.

:::tip Do this
- "high blood pressure" instead of "hypertension"
- "cancer-causing" instead of "carcinogenic"
:::

When Veterans need specific medical terminology their providers use, include the term with a plain language explanation:

:::tip Example
A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a sudden jolt to your head that changes the way your brain works.
:::

## Person-first language

Put the person before their condition to avoid defining individuals by illness or status.

:::tip Do this
- "Veteran with cancer" not "cancer patient"
- "Veteran with diabetes" not "diabetic Veteran"
- "Veteran with higher body weight" not "obese Veteran"
:::

:::danger Not this
- "cancer patient"
- "diabetic Veteran"
- "obese Veteran"
:::

### Identity-first language exception

Some communities prefer identity-first language (for example, "Deaf Veterans" or "blind Veterans"). Use both approaches to respect individual and community preferences.

## Destigmatizing language

For detailed guidance on specific health topics, see:

- [Destigmatizing language for weight](./destigmatizing-language-weight)
- [Destigmatizing language in substance use](./destigmatizing-language-substance-use)

## Destigmatization and hope

Health content should:

- Acknowledge conditions are treatable and manageable
- Use encouraging language
- Include quotes or stories from people with lived experience when appropriate
- Link to support communities and advocacy groups

:::tip Example
Depression is serious but highly treatable. Talk with your health care provider about treatment options.
:::

## Behavior change support

### Focus on small, achievable steps

- Provide specific, actionable instructions
- Use everyday examples and relatable comparisons
- Explain benefits of actions clearly

:::tip Example
Don't lift anything heavier than 10 pounds for the first 2 weeks after surgery. This helps wounds heal faster and reduces bleeding risk. A vacuum cleaner or large garbage bag weighs about 10 pounds.
:::

### Be realistic

Acknowledge practical barriers like budget constraints rather than assuming behavior change is easy.

## Risk communication

### Simplify numbers

- Use comparative language ("1 in 10" vs. "10%")
- Keep denominators consistent when comparing risks
- Focus on absolute risk rather than relative risk

:::tip Example
Studies show eating 50 grams of processed meat daily can increase lifetime colorectal cancer risk from about 5 in 100 to about 6 in 100.
:::

### Pair risk with action

Always follow risk information with action steps that Veterans can take to reduce risk or protect their health.

## VA-specific resources

When discussing behavior change, emphasize VA-specific support and programs rather than generic health advice. Brief mentions of VA expertise are appropriate, but keep focus on Veteran needs and available resources.

:::tip Example
We can help you quit tobacco. Ask your VA health care team about support options or call our tobacco quitline at 855-QUIT-VET (855-784-8838).
