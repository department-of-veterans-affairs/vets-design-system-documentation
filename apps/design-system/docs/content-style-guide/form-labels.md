# Form labels

The VA.gov Design System provides standardized form field labels and their associated hint text and error messages.

:::note In progress
This documentation is actively being developed as the standardization process continues.
:::

## Standardized label categories

The design system provides guidance for form labels organized under the "Ask users for..." pattern section:

- **Addresses** - Guidelines for collecting address information
- **Dates** - Standards for date input fields
- **Email address** - Rules for email field labels
- **Names** - Conventions for name collection fields
- **Phone numbers** - Standards for telephone input
- **Social Security or VA file number** - Guidance for sensitive identifier fields

## How to access detailed guidance

Each category links to its respective pattern page within the design system, where you'll find specific content considerations, examples, and implementation guidance for that particular form field type.

## Additional resources

The form labels documentation is part of the broader VA.gov Design System content style guide, which covers error messages, plain language standards, and other content guidelines for federal government forms.
