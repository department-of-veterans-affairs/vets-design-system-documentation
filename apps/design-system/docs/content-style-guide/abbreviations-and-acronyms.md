# Abbreviations and acronyms

VA.gov follows AP Stylebook guidelines for abbreviations and acronyms, prioritizing plain language by minimizing their use unless they're widely recognized by the general public.

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations are avoided on VA.gov except in specific contexts:

- Common time references (a.m./p.m.)
- Titles before names (Mr., Mrs., Dr.)
- Degree credentials (Ph.D., M.D.)
- Space-limited formats like callout boxes or alerts may use abbreviated days and months

When uncertain, consult the AP Stylebook.

## Acronyms

### Standard practice

First mention in body copy should present the full term followed by the acronym in parentheses. Subsequent references use only the acronym.

**Examples:**
- Initial: "Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI)"
- Later: "TSGLI"

### Page titles and meta tags exception

When character limits or scannability concerns arise in H1 headers or meta title tags, acronyms alone are acceptable. The spelled-out term should appear in the first body mention.

:::tip
Veterans' familiarity matters—prioritize the term users recognize best and search for most frequently, especially in headers.

## Internal acronyms

Never use internal VA office acronyms on external-facing pages. Always spell out full office names to prevent confusion, as multiple offices sometimes share identical acronyms.

**Example:** OCC could refer to:
- Office of Community Care
- Office of Corporate Communications
- Office of Connected Care

Per AP Stylebook: "Names not commonly before the public should not be reduced to acronyms solely to save a few words."
