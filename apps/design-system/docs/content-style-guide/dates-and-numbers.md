# Dates, times, phone numbers, and addresses

## Dates and years

### General rules

- Spell out dates in body copy, using the full construction: March 31, 1989
- Write date ranges using complete sentence structure: "December 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025"
- Add commas after years in full date construction, except at sentence end
- Spell out days of the week and months in body copy

### Abbreviated formats

Space-constrained areas allow abbreviations:

- **Days:** Mon., Tue., Wed., Thu., Fri., Sat., Sun.
- **Months:** Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec. (March, April, May, June, July remain full)
- Form fields use mm/dd/yyyy format
- Use hyphens without spaces for limited-space date ranges

### Special cases

- Use "9/11" only in program names like Post-9/11 GI Bill
- Decades use no apostrophe: "the early 2000s" not "2000's"

## Times and time zones

### Formatting standards

- Write out times, using a.m. and p.m. with periods: 9:00 a.m.
- Spell out noon and midnight. Don't use 12:00 p.m. or 12:00 a.m.
- Include minutes even for hour markers
- Office hours always reference ET timezone

### International and local usage

- International zones use country names or UTC offsets
- User-facing timestamps show local time zones
- Body copy uses sentence construction: "9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET"
- Limited space uses hyphens without surrounding spaces

### Incorrect examples

- ❌ 8 a.m. (missing minutes)
- ❌ from 8:00 a.m. to noon ET (redundant construction)

## Phone numbers

### Formatting requirements

- Use hyphens between number groups: 212-123-1234
- Include "+1" only for international contexts
- Extensions format: "202-123-1234, ext. 9"
- TTY format: "866-440-1238 (TTY: 711)"
- Always include operation hours with phone numbers

### Linking and accessibility

- Hyperlink entire phone numbers and TTY information
- Don't link preceding verbs like "call" or "text"
- Avoid vanity numbers in body copy for accessibility
- Exception: marketing/promotional components may use "877-222-VETS (8387)"

### Correct example

"Call us toll free at [800-827-1000](tel:+18008271000) ([TTY: 711](tel:711)). We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET."

## Fax numbers

- Never hyperlink or add aria labels
- Clarify in surrounding text that it's a fax number

**Example:** "If you're in the U.S., fax your application to 1-844-531-7818."

## Addresses

### Street names

- Write out street names (street, road, avenue, boulevard, highway, etc.)
- Don't abbreviate
- Follow local conventions for compass points (N, S, E, W)

### Correct format

```
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20500

123 E. 45th Street
New York, NY 67890
```

### Zip codes

- Require only 5-digit codes from Veterans in forms
- When providing addresses, include extended codes with hyphens: 12345-6789
- Don't use periods in "PO Box"
