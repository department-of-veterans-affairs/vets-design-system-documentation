# Plain language

The VA.gov Design System provides comprehensive plain language standards to help Veterans and their families understand essential information. Avoiding vagueness and unnecessary complexity makes it easier for members of the public to understand and apply for important benefits.

## Top 10 plain language standards

### 1. Use short sentences

Limit each sentence to one subject and verb when possible.

:::

### 2. Use simple words and terms

Choose familiar language suited to Veterans and their families.

:::tip Do this
- "get" instead of "obtain"
- "help" instead of "assistance"
- "about" instead of "approximately"
:::

### 3. Use active voice

Connect actions directly to subjects. Avoid passive constructions lacking clear responsibility.

:::

:::

### 4. Define complex terms

When necessary, provide plain language definitions in parentheses or separate sentences immediately following technical terms.

:::tip Example

Employ contractions like "don't" instead of "do not" for a more conversational tone.
