# Error and alert messages

Error and alert messages communicate system issues and guide user actions. These messages should be clear, direct, and include a call to action (CTA) that tells the person what to do next to resolve the issue.

## Title length

Keep error and alert message titles to approximately 50 characters (including spaces). Titles should align with general page and section title guidelines.

## Message categories

The VA.gov Design System organizes messages into four types:

### System messages

Alert users to important system-related issues or statuses initiated by the system rather than user actions.

[View system message guidelines](./system)

### Engagement messages

Recommend that users enter or update data. These can be initiated by either the system or another person.

[View engagement message guidelines](./engagement)

### Access messages

Appear when users attempt to access unavailable items such as deleted records or content requiring specific permissions.

[View access message guidelines](./access)

### Feedback messages

Respond to user actions, particularly for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations.

[View feedback message guidelines](./feedback)

## Context

These messages primarily appear in interactive experiences including tools, forms, and applications. The visual design and formatting affect how content is presented.

For implementation guidance, see the [Help users to recover from errors](/docs/patterns/help-users-to/recover-from-errors) pattern.
