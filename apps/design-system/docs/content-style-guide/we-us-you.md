# We, us, you

Use first-person pronouns (we, us, our) when referring to VA, and second-person pronouns (you, your) when addressing Veterans, service members, family members, and other audiences. This approach supports person-to-person communication.

## Recommended approach

:::tip Example
We offer a variety of health services and VA benefits to meet your needs. For additional contact information, view our phone directory.
:::

This demonstrates conversational tone by combining organizational perspective with direct audience address.

## Identifying your audience

When clarity requires it, identify the specific audience before or alongside using second-person language:

:::tip Example
If you're a dependent family member of a Veteran or service member, you can get career and educational counseling through VR&E.
:::

This maintains direct address while specifying which group the content targets.

## What to avoid

:::danger Don't do this
- Third-person references to audiences: "Veterans may also view..."
- Organizational references that create distance: "VA encourages Veterans to..."
:::

These patterns undermine the conversational, person-centered communication style.

## Core principle

Direct, inclusive language strengthens connection with users by treating them as conversation partners rather than subjects being discussed.
