# Button labels

Button labels serve as critical calls-to-action and should receive priority placement equivalent to essential page content. For simple navigation, use links instead of buttons.

## Formatting rules

- **Case**: Use sentence case (except for Button - Icon)
- **Length**: Keep labels under 35 characters; prioritize brevity
- **Action-oriented**: Employ recognizable action verbs that clearly communicate outcomes
- **Structure**: Make every label action-focused

## Writing guidelines

:::tip Do this
- "Create an account"
- "File a complaint"
:::

:::danger Not this
- "Get started"
- "Complaint filing"
:::

## Privacy considerations

Button text must avoid Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI) when possible.

:::warning Important limitation
When PII/PHI appears in button text, click event tracking becomes unavailable. This protection prevents sensitive information from appearing in analytics or logs.
:::

Teams should either:
- Redesign button language to exclude sensitive data, or
- Implement alternative data collection methods
