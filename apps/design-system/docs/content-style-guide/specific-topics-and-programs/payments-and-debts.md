# Payments and debts

This guide establishes consistent terminology for VA communications regarding payments and debts, including benefit overpayments and copay bills.

## Key considerations

Two principles guide all debt-related messaging:

1. **Help availability**: Communications should emphasize that support exists through repayment plans and relief options
2. **Timely action**: Messaging should stress the 30-day window to avoid late fees and collection action

## Terminology reference

### Balance

The remaining amount owed on a debt or copay obligation. Primarily used within online debt portals.

### Benefit overpayment

When VA disburses excess funds for disability, education, or pension benefits. Use "benefit overpayment" on first mention; shorten to "overpayment" thereafter.

:::tip Example

:::

### Compromise offer

A debt relief option allowing Veterans to propose a lump-sum settlement for less than the full amount owed.

### Copay / Copayment

A fixed amount you owe for a health care service. Define on first mention in general contexts.

:::tip Example

### Copay bill / Patient statement

### Debt

The overarching term for any funds owed to VA. Encompasses both overpayments and copays.

### Debt relief

VA assistance options including waivers, compromises, and repayment arrangements.

### Monthly offset

### Outstanding debt

Current unpaid obligations. Used in MyVA and mobile app headers.

### Payment history

Record of VA disbursements to Veterans.

### Repay / Pay

- Use "repay" for overpayment obligations
- Use "pay" for copay bills
- "Make a payment" works for both

### Repayment plan

A monthly payment arrangement option available for both overpayment and copay debt.

### Waiver (debt forgiveness)

A request to forgive full or partial debt obligations. Include the parenthetical "(debt forgiveness)" on first mention.

:::tip Example

### Write-off

A cancellation request option for copay debt only. Not available for overpayments.

## Retired terminology

| Benefit debt | Overpayment |

"Benefit debt" was replaced with "overpayment" as less stigmatizing language.
