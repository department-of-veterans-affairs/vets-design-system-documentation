# Sign in and identity verification

This guide establishes consistent language standards for discussing VA sign-in accounts and identity verification processes across communication channels.

## Key considerations

### Account provider emphasis

The guidance prioritizes encouraging Login.gov accounts while supporting ID.me as alternatives. Both should be referred to as "account types" rather than separate tools.

### Bolding convention

Bold account type names when referencing them: **Login.gov**, **ID.me**, **DS Logon**, and **My HealtheVet**.

:::tip Example
You can use your **Login.gov** account to access VA benefits and services.
:::

:::danger Not this
You can use Login.gov to access VA benefits and services.
:::

### Benefit-focused messaging

Communications should emphasize Veteran advantages (fraud prevention, information protection) rather than VA's security obligations.

## Terminology standards

### Account / Sign-in account

Describes the authentication mechanism Veterans use to access VA services.

:::danger Don't use
- "VA.gov account"
- "VA account"
- "credential"
:::

### Account provider

References Login.gov and ID.me as verification service suppliers.

:::danger Don't use
- "sign-in partner"
- "service provider"
:::

### Identity verification

Describes the one-time initial verification process.

:::tip First mention
verify your identity for your account
:::

:::tip Subsequent mentions
verify
:::

:::danger Don't apply to
- Routine sign-ins
- Multifactor authentication
- LOROTA processes
:::

### Identity-verified account

Use on initial reference, then shorten to **verified account** thereafter.

### Multifactor authentication

The ongoing security process during sign-in. This is distinct from identity verification.

### My HealtheVet

Two words with a lowercase "e." The "e" is only italicized in the logo and print materials, not in digital body copy.

### Security standards

Use "meets modern security standards" when describing providers.

### Sign in / Sign out

The preferred terminology for authentication actions.

:::danger Don't use
- "log in" / "log out"
- "sign on"
:::

## Retired terminology

| Don't use | Use instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| 2-factor authentication | multifactor authentication |
| My HealtheVet basic/advanced/Premium | My HealtheVet account (with security level specification if needed) |
| Sign-in partner / service provider | account provider |
