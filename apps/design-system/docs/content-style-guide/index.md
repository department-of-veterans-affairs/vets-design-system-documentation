# Content style guide

The VA.gov content style guide is a shared resource across VA administrations and teams, designed to ensure consistent communication with Veterans and non-Veteran customers. It's a living document that will change over time, based on user research and feedback.

## Purpose

This guide establishes house style standards for VA.gov, enabling the organization to speak with one voice and create a consistent, helpful experience for all users.

## Key guidance resources

The style guide is built on two foundational elements:

1. **Content principles** - These establish the voice and tone used across VA.gov, grounded in how the organization communicates for and with Veterans in mind

2. **Plain language and web best practices** - The guide emphasizes these standards, with specific callouts for areas where VA.gov diverges from conventional practices

## What's covered

The guide addresses common writing issues specific to VA.gov, but explicitly excludes basic grammar and mechanics. For topics not covered, the guide directs users to:

- AP Style
- Merriam-Webster Dictionary
- VA Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs style guide

## Organization

The guide is organized into searchable topic sections covering areas like abbreviations, error messages, form labels, health content, and plain language standards.
