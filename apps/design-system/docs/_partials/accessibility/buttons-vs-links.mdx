### Buttons vs. links

It's important to use the correct element for the intended action:

**Use a button when:**
- Submitting a form
- Triggering an action (save, delete, cancel)
- Opening a modal or dialog
- Toggling a state
- Performing a JavaScript action

**Use a link when:**
- Navigating to another page
- Navigating to an anchor on the same page
- Opening a resource in a new tab

#### Decision flowchart

```
Is the action navigating to a new page or anchor?
├── Yes → Use a link (<a>)
└── No → Does the action submit a form?
    ├── Yes → Use a submit button (<button type="submit">)
    └── No → Use a button (<button type="button">)
```

#### Why this matters

- **Screen readers** announce buttons and links differently, setting user expectations
- **Keyboard users** expect different behaviors (Enter for links, Enter/Space for buttons)
- **Search engines** follow links but ignore buttons
- **Browser behavior** differs (links can be opened in new tabs, bookmarked, etc.)
