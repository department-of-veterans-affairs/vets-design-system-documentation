### Touch target size

Interactive elements must have adequate touch target sizes for users with motor impairments or those using touch devices.

**Requirements:**
- **Minimum size:** 44×44 CSS pixels (WCAG 2.2 Level AA)
- **Recommended size:** 48×48 CSS pixels for better usability
- **Spacing:** At least 8px between adjacent interactive elements

**Why this matters:**
- Users with motor impairments may have difficulty tapping small targets
- Touch screens require larger targets than mouse pointers
- Prevents accidental activation of adjacent elements

The Button component meets these requirements by default. Don't override the padding or min-height to make buttons smaller than the minimum target size.
