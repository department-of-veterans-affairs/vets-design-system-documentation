# Information Architecture

Information architecture focuses on organizing, labeling, and navigating information to help people discover what they need, understand their location within an experience, and accomplish their goals.

## IA Principles

The VA.gov platform and VA Health and Benefits mobile app follow seven core principles:

### 1. User-Centered Design

Research how people categorize and search for information to inform organizational decisions.

### 2. Sense of Place

Always provide a sense of place by using design components and content to show visitors where they are within the experience and where they can go next.

### 3. Consistency

Apply uniform organizational structure and labels across digital and physical touchpoints.

### 4. Prioritization

Limit and prioritize information to enhance discoverability, reduce cognitive load, and allow self-paced exploration.

### 5. Findability

Present information aligned with user mental models and offer multiple discovery pathways.

### 6. Focused Navigation

Use clear menus and labeling with distinct calls-to-action to reduce friction and cognitive burden.

### 7. Scalability

Design flexible systems allowing content and information to evolve over time.

## When to Consider IA

Apply IA thinking when:

- Launching new features or content
- Adding categories to the mobile app
- Creating subdomains or subdirectories
- Redesigning or restructuring pages
- Improving content discoverability
- Removing features or content
- Modifying global navigation elements
