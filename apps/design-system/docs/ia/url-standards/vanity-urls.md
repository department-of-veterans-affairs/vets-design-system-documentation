# Vanity URLs

A vanity URL is a short, simple, memorable, and readable URL that utilizes the existing domain (va.gov) and automatically redirects visitors to a specific page.

## Example

`www.va.gov/trust` directs users to `https://www.va.gov/initiatives/veteran-trust-in-va/`

## Distinction from Shortened URLs

A shortened URL uses randomized characters rather than meaningful words. VA does not offer URL-shortener services and discourages external services (like bitly.com) due to blocking and trustworthiness concerns.

## Key Characteristics

- Begin with `www.va.gov` exclusively
- No subdomains (e.g., `education.va.gov`)
- No custom top-level domains (e.g., `www.va.apply`)
- The vanity segment must be brief, typeable, and memorable
- User's browser displays the final canonical URL after redirect

## Appropriate Use Cases

Implement vanity URLs for campaigns that:

- Target Veterans, family members, or caregivers
- Have national (not local) scope
- Direct to a dedicated campaign landing page

## Inappropriate Applications

Vanity URLs should NOT be used for:

- External content beyond VA.gov
- File or document downloads (PDFs)
- General benefit information or tools
- Resources and support content
- Unfinished URL reservations

## Selection Criteria

- Prioritize pronounceability and ease of entry for print, video, and audio campaigns
- Consider assistive technology compatibility
- Use contextually relevant keywords
- Avoid sensitive or alarming terminology
- Maintain consistency with general URL standards

## Request Process

Submit vanity URL requests to VA.gov Information Architecture for validation, approval, and implementation.
